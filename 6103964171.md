**Introduction**
===============

Hello ماهان! Today, we're going on an adventure in a big city, just like yours! Do you know what makes our city a happy place? It's the tall trees that give us shade and fresh air! Let's explore and learn why trees are so special.

**Story**
=======

One sunny day, ماهان was playing in the park near his home when he saw a big, old tree. The tree was covered with green leaves and colorful flowers. *Wow!* A friendly bird named Sami was perched on a branch.

"Hello, ماهان!" said Sami. "This is our home, and we need your help. Some people want to cut down our tree to build a new building. We love our tree and don't want it to go away."

ماهان looked worried. "I don't want the tree to go away either!" he said.

Sami explained, "Trees help keep our air clean, provide shade, and are homes for many animals like me. We can ask the people not to cut it down, but we need your help."

ماهان thought for a moment. Here are some options he could choose:

*   Ask his friends to help him make posters to show the people why the tree is important.
*   Talk to the people and explain why the tree should not be cut down.
*   Plant more trees in the park so everyone can enjoy them.

ماهان chose the first option. He made colorful posters with his friends, and they wrote messages like "Trees are our friends!" and "Save our tree!"

As they showed the posters to the people, ماهان explained why the tree was important. The people were impressed and decided not to cut down the tree.

The tree was saved, and Sami thanked ماهان for his help. "You're a superhero, ماهان! Trees are special, and we must protect them."

**Conclusion**
============

ماهان was happy that the tree was safe. He learned that trees are our friends and help keep our city clean and green. We can all be like ماهان and help protect trees.

Here are some things you can do to help trees, just like ماهان:

*   Plant trees in your neighborhood or park.
*   Ask your parents to help you water trees.
*   Tell your friends why trees are important.

Remember, every small action can make a big difference! Keep exploring, learning, and taking care of our Earth.
