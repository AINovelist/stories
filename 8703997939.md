**مهدی and the Magic Trash Can**
=====================================

**Introduction**
---------------

مهسا, do you know what happens to the trash we throw away every day? Does it just disappear? Let's go on an adventure to find out!

**Story**
--------

One sunny day in the city, مهسا was playing in her neighborhood park when she met a friendly squirrel named$menu. منو was known for being very tidy and loved keeping the park clean. He was collecting trash in his special Magic Trash Can.

مهدی: "Wow, منو! You have a Magic Trash Can! How does it work?"

منو: "Ah, مهسا! This can sorts the trash into recycling, compost, and waste. But it needs our help to do its magic. Want to be my assistant?"

**Interactive Middle**
---------------------

As they collected trash, they came across different types of waste:

1. **Old Newspaper**: Should we recycle it or throw it away?
   - A) Recycle it  
   - B) Throw it away
   (Choose A)

مهدی and منو put the newspaper in the recycling bin. Well done!

2. **Food Waste**: What should we do with it?
   - A) Put it in the regular trash  
   - B) Compost it
   (Choose B)

مهدی and منو added the food waste to the compost bin. Great job!

**Conclusion**
--------------

After a fun-filled day, مهسا helped منو fill the Magic Trash Can with sorted trash.

منو: "awesome work, مهسا! By reducing waste and recycling, we help our planet stay clean and healthy. You're a true friend to the environment!"

مهسا learned that even small actions can make a big difference in taking care of the Earth. What will you do today to help reduce waste, مهسا?

* Encourage your family to recycle.
