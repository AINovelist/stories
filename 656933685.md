**Water Conservation Adventure: جاوید's Quest**
=====================================================

**Introduction**
---------------

جاوید, have you ever wondered where the water in your city comes from? Do you know how important it is to conserve this precious resource?

**Story**
--------

جاوید loved playing with water in the city park on hot summer days. One day, while splashing around in the fountain, he met a friendly fish named Finley. Finley told جاوید that the city's water supply was running low and that every drop counted.

Finley took جاوید on an underwater journey to show him where the city's water came from. They swam through the pipes and met a wise old turtle named Terry. Terry explained that:

*   **Only 2.5% of the Earth's water is freshwater**.
*   **Most of the freshwater is frozen in glaciers**.
*   **The remaining freshwater is what we use for drinking, washing, and playing**.

Terry asked جاوید to help him solve a problem. The city's park was wasting a lot of water due to leaky pipes and overwatering. Finley and جاوید decided to work together to fix the issue.

Here are the choices جاوید faced:

1.  **Fix the leaky pipes**: جاوید and Finley could find the leaking pipes and fix them to stop the water from wasting.
2.  **Tell the park ranger**: They could tell the park ranger about the problem and let him fix it.
3.  **Use a drip irrigation system**: They could install a drip irrigation system to water the plants more efficiently.

What do you think جاوید should do?

**Conclusion**
----------

جاوید and Finley decided to **fix the leaky pipes** and **install a drip irrigation system**. They worked together and succeeded in saving a lot of water. The park ranger was so proud of them that he gave them a special award.

جاوید learned that **every small action can make a big difference** in conserving water. He realized that he could help save water at home too by:

*   **Turning off the tap while brushing his teeth**.
*   **Taking shorter showers**.
*   **Telling his family and friends about the importance of water conservation**.

Finley and Terry said goodbye to جاوید, thanking him for his help. They told him that he was now a **Water Conservation Hero**.

From that day on, جاوید
