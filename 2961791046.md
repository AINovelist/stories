**Introduction**
================

Hello Shabnam! Let's go on an exciting adventure in your suburban neighborhood. Imagine you're playing in your backyard on a sunny day, surrounded by trees, flowers, and the warm sunshine. Suddenly, you notice that there's a lot of trash and waste scattered around the yard. What do you think we can do to make our neighborhood cleaner and more beautiful?

**Story**
==========

You look around and see a friendly rabbit named Rosie hopping towards you. Rosie loves the environment and wants to teach you about waste reduction.

"Hello Shabnam! I'm Rosie. I've noticed that there's a lot of waste in our neighborhood. We need to work together to reduce, reuse, and recycle," says Rosie.

Rosie hands you a recycling bin and a trash bag. "Let's separate the waste into different categories. Can you help me sort out the plastic bottles, paper, and food waste?"

You start sorting the waste together. You learn that plastic bottles can be recycled, paper can be reused, and food waste can be composted.

As you're sorting, you notice a big pile of old toys and broken items. Rosie suggests, "Hey Shabnam, why don't we have a garage sale or donate these items to someone who might need them? We can reduce waste by giving old items a new home."

You smile and say, "That's a great idea, Rosie!"

**Challenge Time!**
--------------------

Oh no! A strong wind blows, and some of the sorted waste gets mixed up again. What do you do?

A) Try to sort it out again by yourself
B) Ask a family member for help
C) Use a tool, like a rake, to make it easier
D) Give up and leave it for someone else to do

What's your choice, Shabnam?

**Conclusion**
==============

You decide to ask a family member for help, and together you sort out the waste again. Rosie is so proud of you for working together and making a difference.

Remember, Shabnam, every small action you take can make a big impact on our environment. By reducing waste, reusing items, and recycling, you're helping to keep our neighborhood clean and beautiful.
