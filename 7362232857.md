**Introduction**
================

Hello عاطفه! Today, we're going on an exciting adventure in a big city, just like yours! You know how we always throw away things we don't need anymore? Well, today we're going to learn about how to reduce waste and help keep our city clean.

**Story**
=========

Once upon a time, in a city filled with tall buildings and busy streets, there lived a little girl named عاطفه (just like you!). She loved playing in the park near her house, but she noticed that there was always trash scattered around. Plastics, papers, and broken toys were everywhere!

One day, while عاطفه was playing, she met a friendly squirrel named Squeaky. Squeaky was sad because his home, a beautiful tree, was surrounded by trash. He asked عاطفه for help.

"Please, عاطفه, can you help me clean up this mess?" Squeaky asked.

عاطفه thought for a moment, and then said, "Of course, Squeaky! But how can we do it?"

Squeaky smiled and said, "We can start by reducing our waste! Let's sort the trash into different bins: plastics, papers, and recyclables."

Here's where you come in, عاطفه! What do you think they should do first?

--------------------

What would you like to do?

A) Throw away all the trash in one big bin
B) Help Squeaky sort the trash into different bins
C) Go home and forget about the problem

Choose your answer: (please imagine the child responding, and we'll proceed accordingly)

**Let's assume عاطفه chooses B) Help Squeaky sort the trash into different bins**

"Great choice, عاطفه!" Squeaky exclaimed. "Let's get started! We can use these bins to sort the trash."

Together, عاطفه and Squeaky sorted the trash into different bins. They put plastics in one bin, papers in another, and recyclables in a special bin.

As they worked, Squeaky taught عاطفه about the 3Rs: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.

* **Reduce**: Try to use less of something to create less waste.
* **Reuse**: Use something again instead of throwing it away.
* **Recycle**: Turn old things into new things.

After sorting the trash, عاطفه and Squeaky cleaned up the park. The tree looked happy
