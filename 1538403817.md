**Introduction**
In a mountainous region, where the air is crisp and the trees are tall, there lives a young boy named **Hadi**. Hadi loves exploring the outdoors and learning about the amazing creatures that live in the mountains. One day, he stumbled upon a fascinating world of animals that needed his help.

**Story**

As Hadi wandered through the mountains, he came across a wise old owl named Olwen. Olwen had been watching Hadi from afar and was impressed by his curiosity and kindness towards animals.

"Hadi, the mountains are facing a big problem," said Olwen. "Many animals are losing their homes due to human activities. We need your help to protect them."

Hadi's eyes widened with concern. "What can I do, Olwen?"

"I need you to help me find the three ancient trees that are the homes of our animal friends," said Olwen. "But be warned, Hadi, the journey will be challenging, and you'll need to make some tough choices."

Hadi nodded bravely. "I'm ready, Olwen. Let's start our adventure!"

Together, Hadi and Olwen set off on their journey. They walked through dense forests, crossed rushing streams, and climbed steep hills. Along the way, they encountered various animals, each with their own unique story.

As they approached the first ancient tree, they met a family of beavers who were struggling to build a new dam. The beavers asked Hadi for help in gathering materials.

Do you want Hadi to:
a) Help the beavers gather materials
