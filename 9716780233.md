جاوید was excited to spend his summer vacation exploring the outdoors. He loved playing in the sprinklers and running through the water spray on hot days. But one day, while playing in his suburban backyard, he noticed that the sprinklers were on for a long time, and the water was starting to pool on the ground. His mom reminded him that water is a precious resource and should be conserved. جاوید wondered, "What can I do to help save water?"
