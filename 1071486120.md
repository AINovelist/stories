**Introduction**
================

Hello **ماهان**! Do you know why we need water to survive? Just like our bodies need food to grow strong, our planet needs water to stay healthy. Water is essential for us, animals, and plants. But did you know that water is getting scarce in many places? Let's go on an adventure to learn how we can help save water.

**Story**
==========

In a bustling city, just like yours, there lived a little rabbit named Remy. Remy loved playing with his friends in the park, but he noticed that the plants were wilting, and the pond was drying up. Remy wondered, "What's happening to our park? Why is the water disappearing?"

One day, while Remy was exploring the city, he met a wise old owl named Olwen. Olwen said, "Hello, little Remy! I see you're curious about the park's water problem. Would you like to help me solve the mystery?"

Remy eagerly nodded, and together they set out to explore the city's water system. They visited the water treatment plant, where they met a friendly worker named Ms. Drops. Ms. Drops explained, "We treat water to make it clean and safe for everyone. But we need your help to conserve it!"

Olwen asked Remy, "What do you think is the biggest water-wasting habit in our city?" Remy thought for a moment and then said, "I see my mom and dad leaving the tap on while brushing their teeth!"

Olwen smiled, "That's a great observation, Remy! Now, let's make a plan to save water. What can we do?"

Do you, **ماهان**, have any ideas?

**What would you like to do?**

A) Ask everyone to turn off the tap while brushing their teeth
B) Fix the leaky faucets in the park
C) Create a watering schedule for the plants
D) Other (please tell us your idea!)
