**Introduction**
[:watering can: ] Hello سپیده! Do you know how important water is for our village? Just like how you need water to drink and wash your hands, plants and animals need water to survive too! Let's go on an adventure to learn more about water conservation.

**Story**

One sunny day, سپیده decided to visit her grandmother who lives near the village well. As she walked, she noticed that the plants and crops were looking dry and thirsty. Her grandmother explained that the village well was running low on water due to a long drought.

Grandmother asked سپیده to help her find ways to save water. They sat together under a shady tree and thought about it. Suddenly, سپیده had an idea!

"I can help, Grandma! I remember learning about water cycles in school. We can collect rainwater and use it to water the plants!"

Grandmother was proud of سپیده's idea and said, "That's a great start! But we need to do more. What else can we do to save water?"

**Interactive Middle**

Sپیده thought for a moment and said, "I know! We can:

* Fix the leaky faucets at home
* Take shorter baths to save water
* Help mom use a bucket to wash the dishes instead of letting the water run
* Tell our friends and family to turn off the tap while brushing their teeth

Grandmother smiled and said, "Those are all great ideas, سپیده! Now, let's make a plan to put them into action."

Together, they made a list and started working on each task. After a few days, the villagers noticed a big difference. The well was filling up, and the plants were looking healthy again!

**Conclusion**

Sپیده learned that every small action can make a big difference in saving water. She realized that she has the power to help protect the environment and her village.

*Remember, سپیده: every drop counts, and every small action can make a big splash!*

From now on, سپیده made sure to practice water conservation in her daily life and encouraged her friends and family to do the same. The villagers were proud of her and thanked her for helping to save their well.

What can you do today to help save water, سپیده?
