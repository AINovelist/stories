**Introduction**
================

In a sunny suburb, surrounded by green trees and happy birds, lived a curious 5-year-old boy named ماهان (Mahān). ماهان loved playing outside, exploring nature, and watching the trees sway gently in the breeze. One day, while playing in his backyard, ماهان noticed that one of the big trees was looking sad and bare. He wondered, **"Why is the tree looking so unhappy?"**

**Story**
=====

As ماهان approached the tree, a friendly squirrel named Squeaky scampered down from a nearby branch. "Hello, ماهان! I'm Squeaky. I've been taking care of this tree for a long time. Sadly, the tree is struggling because its leaves are falling off, and it's getting too much direct sunlight."

ماهان asked, "What can we do to help the tree?" Squeaky replied, "We need to provide shade for the tree and water it regularly. But we also need to make sure we're not wasting water." ماهان thought for a moment and said, "I know! We can use a big umbrella to shade the tree, and my mom can help us water it with a bucket instead of a hose!"

Squeaky cheered, "That's a great idea, ماهان! Let's get to work!" Together, they set up the umbrella and watered the tree. As they worked, Squeaky taught ماهان about the importance of:

* **Reducing water waste**
* **Providing shade for trees**
* **Keeping the environment clean**

As the days passed, the tree began to look happier, and its leaves started to grow back. ماهان felt proud of what he had accomplished and asked Squeaky, "What else can we do to help the tree?" Squeaky suggested, "We can plant more trees and flowers around it to keep it company and create a beautiful garden!"

**Conclusion**
==========

ماهان beamed with excitement, knowing he could make a difference in taking care of the tree. He realized that even small actions, like providing shade and watering, can help preserve the trees and keep the environment healthy. As he hugged the tree, Squeaky whispered, "Remember, ماهان, every small action you take can make a big difference in protecting our planet's trees and nature."

From that day on, ماهان continued to care for the tree, and soon, his backyard became a beautiful garden, filled with happy trees, colorful flowers, and
