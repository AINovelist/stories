**Introduction**
================

Hello Javid! Do you know what happens to the trash we throw away in the city? Let's go on an adventure to find out!

**Story**
==========

Javid loved playing in the city park near his home. One day, while playing with his friends, he noticed a lot of trash on the ground. There were plastic bottles, old newspapers, and food wrappers everywhere! Javid wondered, "Where does all this trash go?"

Suddenly, a friendly squirrel named Squeaky appeared. "Hello, Javid! My name is Squeaky, and I'm here to help you learn about waste reduction."

Squeaky took Javid on a journey to the city's recycling center. When they arrived, Javid saw big machines sorting different types of trash. Squeaky explained, "We need to reduce, reuse, and recycle to keep our city clean."

Javid asked, "But how can I help?" Squeaky replied, "You can start by reducing your use of plastic bottles and bags. You can also help your family sort recyclables from trash."

As they walked back to the park, Javid saw many people littering. Squeaky said, "Let's make a pact to pick up one piece of trash each day and put it in the recycling bin." Javid agreed and together they picked up a few pieces of trash.
