===============

**Welcome, محمد!**
---------------

Have you ever wondered what happens to the water you use at home? Where does it come from, and where does it go? Let's dive into an exciting adventure to explore the amazing world of water conservation!

**Story**

**The Mysterious Case of the Disappearing Water**
------------------------------------------

You are محمد, a 7-year-old detective living in a beautiful coastal town. One sunny day, you notice that the water level in the nearby ocean seems lower than usual. The fish are struggling to swim in the shallow waters, and the beach is getting narrower.

Your best friend, a clever seagull named Sami, approaches you with a worried expression. "محمد, have you seen the news? The ocean is in trouble! We need to find out what's happening to our water!"

You both decide to investigate. You examine the beach, talking to the other coastal creatures, and gather clues. You discover that:

* **Leaks in the pipes**: Some of the beachside houses have leaky pipes, wasting precious water.
* **Excessive water usage**: Some people are using too much water for their daily needs, reducing the ocean's water levels.
* **Pollution**: Litter and pollutants are entering the ocean, harming the marine life.

As a young detective, you need to decide how to tackle these problems. Do you:

A) Fix the leaky pipes with Sami's help.
B) Create a poster campaign to raise awareness about water conservation.
C) Organize a beach clean-up event with your friends.

Choose your response:

(Note: Please imagine Muhammad responding, and I'll proceed accordingly)

Assuming محمد chooses option B) Create a poster campaign...

**You and Sami create eye-catching posters with water-saving tips**:

* Take shorter showers
* Fix leaky pipes
* Turn off the tap while brushing teeth
* Use a water-efficient showerhead

You both display the posters around the town, encouraging everyone to join the water-conservation effort.

**As a result of your campaign**:

* People start fixing their leaky pipes and reducing their water usage.
* The beach clean-up event is a huge success, with many participants removing trash and pollutants from the ocean.
* The ocean's water levels start to rise, and the fish begin to thrive again.
