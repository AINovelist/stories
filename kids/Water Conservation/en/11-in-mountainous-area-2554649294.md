================

**Welcome to "Ahmad's Mountainous Mission"**
Ahmad, have you ever wondered how the water in your mountainous home gets to your tap? Let's embark on an exciting adventure to discover the importance of water conservation and how you can make a difference.

**Story**
==========

Once upon a time, in a beautiful mountainous village, Ahmad loved exploring the outdoors. One sunny day, while hiking with his guide, **Ms. Luna**, a wise and experienced environmentalist, Ahmad stumbled upon a babbling brook. As they sat on a nearby rock, Ms. Luna asked Ahmad:

"Ahmad, have you ever thought about where this water comes from and where it goes?"

Ahmad thought for a moment and replied, "I think it comes from the mountain and flows into the river."

Ms. Luna smiled, "That's correct! But do you know what happens when we waste water?"

As they continued their journey, they encountered a few scenarios that made Ahmad think about the impact of his actions on the environment:

* They saw a leaky pipe near a farmhouse, wasting precious water. Ms. Luna explained that a single drop of water can make a big difference when wasted.
* They met a group of animals struggling to find clean drinking water due to polluted streams.
* They visited a household using rainwater harvesting systems to collect and conserve water.

Ms. Luna asked Ahmad to help her decide how to address these issues:

**What should we do first?**
A) Fix the leaky pipe
B) Help the animals find a new source of water
C) Install rainwater harvesting systems in every household
D) Tell the villagers about the importance of water conservation
