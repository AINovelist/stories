**Introduction**
In the heart of the city, where the sun shines bright and the streets are buzzing with excitement, there lives a young curious boy named علی. He loves exploring the world around him and learning new things. One day, his mom asks him, "علی, have you ever wondered where the water comes from that we use every day?" علی thinks for a moment and then asks, "Mom, is it from the tap?" His mom smiles and says, "That's a great question, let's go on an adventure to find out!"

**Story**
Unfortunately, his city was going through a severe drought, and water was becoming scarce. The once-lush parks and gardens were now dry and brown. But علی was determined to help. He met a friendly water droplet named Drippy, who became his guide on this adventure. Drippy explained to علی that water is a precious resource and that every drop counts.

Drippy and علی visited the city's water treatment plant, where they saw how water is cleaned and filtered before it reaches the taps. But Drippy told علی that there's still much to be done to conserve water. They came up with a plan to teach the city's residents how to save water.

Here are some ways they wanted to share with the city:
* Fixing leaky faucets to save up to 20 gallons of water per day.
* Taking shorter showers to save up to 2.5 gallons per minute.
* Using a bucket to wash cars instead of a hose to save up to 10 gallons per minute.

But, oh no! The mischievous "Water Waster" villain is trying to stop them! He's pouring water recklessly everywhere! Drippy and علی need your help to stop him!
