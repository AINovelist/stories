**Story for علی, aged 6**
==========================

**Introduction**
---------------

**Hey علی!** Do you know what's essential for our planet and all living things? **Water!** Just like how we need water to drink, wash, and play, plants and animals also depend on it to survive. But have you ever wondered what happens when we waste water?

**Story**
---------

Once upon a time, in a sunny suburb just like yours, **علی** loved playing in his backyard with his best friend, a clever and adventurous rabbit named **Remy**. One day, while they were playing with a hose, **Remy** said, " علی, do you know that water is precious and we should save it?"

"I thought water was everywhere!" replied **علی**.

**Remy** explained, "Yes, but only a small amount of water is drinkable. We must be careful not to waste it." Just then, they saw a dripping faucet in the garden. **Remy** asked, **علی** to help him solve the mystery of the dripping faucet.

**What would you do, علی?**
A) Fix the faucet right away
B) Ignore it and keep playing
C) Call a grown-up for help
D) Use more water to make the drip bigger

Choose your answer:

(Note: Please imagine the child responds with one of the options, and the story will proceed accordingly. For this example, let's assume the child chooses option A.)

**Great choice, علی!** You and **Remy** decided to fix the faucet together. After tightening the loose screw, the dripping stopped!

**Remy** was so proud of **علی** and said, "You saved water and helped our planet!" But then, they saw a puddle of water on the ground.

"What can we do with this extra water?" asked **Remy**.

**What would you suggest, علی?**
A) Pour it down the drain
B) Water the nearby plants
C) Make a mini-pond for fish
D) Take it to the kitchen to drink

Choose your answer:

(Let's assume the child responds with option B.)

**Excellent idea, علی!** You and **Remy** decided to water the nearby plants. They smiled and thanked you for the extra drink.

**Conclusion**

**Well done, علی!** You and **Remy** saved water and helped the plants. Remember, every small action we take can make a big difference
