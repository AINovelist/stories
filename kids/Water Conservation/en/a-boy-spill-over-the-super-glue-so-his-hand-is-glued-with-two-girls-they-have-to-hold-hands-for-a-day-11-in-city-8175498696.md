### Introduction
Imagine you're **Max**, an 11-year-old boy living in a bustling city, where the sound of cars and chatter fills the air. One day, while working on a craft project, you accidentally **spill super glue** all over your hands and, in a chaotic moment, you find them stuck to the hands of your two classmates, **Emma** and **Olivia**.

### Story
As you, Emma, and Olivia try to figure out how to get unstuck, you decide to make the most of your situation.
