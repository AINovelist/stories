**Introduction**
---------------

*Hello, Atefe! Do you know why water is essential for our planet?* Water is life, and we need it to drink, play, and even to help plants grow. But, did you know that water is a precious resource that needs our care and protection? In this story, Atefe, you will go on an exciting adventure to learn about water conservation and how you can make a difference in your city.

**Story**
--------

It's a sunny day in your city, and the park where you love to play is hosting a Water Conservation Fair. The mayor of the city has announced a challenge: to save as much water as possible in the next month. The park's lake, where you like to feed the ducks, is struggling with low water levels.

As you arrive at the fair, you meet a friendly character named **Drippy**, a water droplet with a big smile. Drippy tells you that the lake's water level is low because people in the city are wasting water. Drippy needs your help to solve the problem.

Here's your challenge, Atefe:

**What can you do to help save water in the city?**

A) Fix the leaky faucets in the park
B) Encourage people to take shorter showers
C) Plant water-efficient plants in the park
D) Tell your friends to turn off the tap while brushing their teeth

Choose your answer:

(Note: Please select one of the options above)

**Let's continue with your choice**

*If you chose A) Fix the leaky faucets in the park*

You and Drippy decide to fix the leaky faucets in the park. With the help of a park ranger, you tighten the loose faucets and fix the broken ones. Drippy is so proud of you! With the faucets fixed, the park's water usage decreases, and the lake's water level starts to rise.

*If you chose B) Encourage people to take shorter showers*

You and Drippy create posters and flyers to remind people to take shorter showers. You even come up with a fun song to sing while taking a shower to help people remember to keep it short. The people in the city love your idea, and soon, everyone is taking shorter showers, saving gallons of water.

*If you chose C) Plant water-efficient plants in the park*

You and Drippy plant beautiful water-efficient plants in the park. These plants need less water to survive
