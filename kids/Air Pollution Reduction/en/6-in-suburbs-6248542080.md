**The Air Pollution Adventure of Ali and Sam**

**Introduction**
Have you ever wondered why sometimes the air in our city looks foggy? Meet Ali, a curious 6-year-old who lives in the suburbs and loves playing outside. One sunny day, Ali decides to go on an adventure to learn more about the air he breathes.

**Story**
Ali walked out of his house and took a deep breath. He noticed that the air didn't smell as fresh as it usually did. His friend Sam, a wise old owl, perched on a nearby tree called out to him.
"Hello, Ali! What's on your mind?"
"I was just wondering why the air looks dirty today," Ali replied.
Sam thought for a moment and said, "Let's go on an adventure to find out! We'll explore the city and learn how to reduce air pollution."
Their first stop was the park. They saw people playing with their dogs and children laughing on the swings. But they also noticed some cars driving by with smoke coming out of their exhaust pipes.
*What do you think is causing the air pollution, Ali?*
Ali thought for a moment and said, "I think it's the cars!"
Sam nodded and said, "That's correct! Cars can release bad things into the air when they drive. But there are ways to reduce air pollution. Let's go see some examples."

They visited a nearby bike-sharing station and saw people riding bicycles instead of driving cars. Ali exclaimed, "Wow! Bicycles don't make the air dirty!"
Sam smiled and said, "Exactly! Bicycles are a great way to reduce air pollution. We can also use public transportation, walk, or carpool with friends."

Their next stop was a local community garden. They saw people planting trees and flowers. Ali asked, "How do trees help reduce air pollution?"
Sam explained, "Trees absorb bad things from the air and produce oxygen, which is good for us to breathe. We can all help by planting more trees and taking care of them."

**Decision Time!**
As they continued their adventure, Ali and Sam came across a big, empty lot. Sam said, "Ali, we can make a difference here. What do you think we should do with this lot?"
Do you think Ali should:
A) Build a playground
B) Plant a garden
C) Create a bike park
