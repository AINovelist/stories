Do you know why sometimes it's hard to breathe when we play outside in the city? One sunny day, while playing with his toy cars near the park, Mahan noticed that the air didn't smell very fresh. He saw big trucks driving by and factories nearby sending out yucky smoke. \"Mommy,\" he asked, \"why is the sky gray today?\" His mom smiled and said, \"That's because of something called pollution.\" She explained how bad things people do can hurt our planet and make us sick if we don't take care of Earth properly.\n\n\nWhat could be causing this problem?\n\n(To Be Continued...)"},"image_prompt":"Image of a young boy in a polluted city, daytime.

He looked around and saw many things that might be making the pollution worse. There were plastic bottles thrown away on the ground, cars honking and producing smoke, and even some kids littering. Mahan felt like he had to choose where to start helping first. Should he pick up the trash with his friends, tell people not to throw plastics on the road, or ask his dad to use their bike instead of driving a car next time they go to the store? \n\nWhich option do YOU think Mahan should choose?\nA) Pick up trash \nB) Tell others not to litter\nC) Ride bikes more often\n\n(Mohan has three options but remember only one choice will lead him forward.)"},"image_prompt":"Image of a young boy in a polluted city street, daytime.

He remembered how happy he feels when riding his bike with his dad and how much fun they have together. So, he decided that asking his dad to use their bike instead of driving a car next time they go to the store was the best idea! This way, not only would they reduce the smoke from cars, but they'd also spend quality time together.\n\n\"Hey Dad!\" Mahan exclaimed excitedly during dinner, \"Can we ride our bikes to the store tomorrow? I want to help keep the air clean!\"\n\nHis dad smiled proudly at Mahan's initiative. \"Of course, buddy! That sounds like a fantastic plan. We'll leave early so we can enjoy the fresh morning air.\"\n\nBy choosing this path, Mahan felt brave knowing he was taking small steps towards making a change in reducing pollution in their city.\n\n(Illustrations of Mahan and his father biking happily through less polluted streets could accompany this text.)\n\nNow let's proceed further..."},"image_prompt":"Image of a young boy and his father in a pleasant neighborhood, daytime.

He realized that every small action he takes can make a big difference in keeping the air clean and the Earth healthy. By choosing to ride his bike with his dad instead of driving a car, he contributed to reducing pollution in their city.\n\n\"You see, Mahan,\" his dad explained as they put away their bikes, \"when we all do little things like riding our bikes or picking up trash, it helps keep our city beautiful and safe for everyone. It's like being part of a big team working together to protect our planet.\"\n\nMahan understood now why his mom had told him about taking care of the Earth.
