**Introduction**
================

**Welcome, محسن!**
--------------------

Imagine you are standing in the middle of your village, surrounded by green fields and fresh air. But have you ever noticed that sometimes the air doesn't feel as clean as it should? Let's go on an adventure to discover the secrets of clean air and how we can help keep it that way!

**Story**
==========

**The Mysterious Fog**
----------------------

One day, a thick fog rolled into your village, making it hard to see and breathe. The villagers were worried and didn't know what to do. That's when a wise old owl, Professor Hootenanny, appeared to guide you on a quest to solve the mystery of the fog.

**Your Mission**
----------------

Professor Hootenanny explains that the fog is caused by air pollution from the village's waste and emissions. She gives you a special task:

"محسن, can you help me find the sources of pollution in our village and come up with a plan to reduce them?"

You ride your bike through the village, observing and taking notes. You notice:

* The village dump is overflowing with trash.
* The farmers are burning their fields after harvest.
* The village cars and trucks are emitting yucky fumes.

**What Would You Do?**

You have three options to reduce air pollution in your village:

1. **Organize a village clean-up day** to collect and recycle trash.
2. **Talk to the farmers** about alternative methods to burning their fields.
3. **Encourage the villagers** to use bicycles or walk instead of driving cars.
