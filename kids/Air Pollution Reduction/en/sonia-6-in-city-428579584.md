Hey Sonia! Do you know what makes the air we breathe clean and fresh? Let's go on an adventure to find out! In your city, there are many things that can make the air dirty, like cars and factories. But today, we're going to meet a special friend who will help us learn how to keep the air clean.

**Story**
=======

Once upon a time, in a city not so far away, there was a little fairy named Luna. Luna loved flying around the city, playing with the birds and watching the children play. But one day, she noticed that the air was getting thick and yucky. She couldn't fly as high as she used to, and her wings were getting tired easily.

Luna decided to visit her friend, Professor Green, a wise old owl who knew everything about the environment. Professor Green told Luna that the air pollution was caused by the cars, factories, and other things that people use every day.

"Can you help me, Professor Green?" Luna asked. "I want to make the air clean again!"

"Of course, little fairy!" said Professor Green. "But we need your help, Sonia!" Professor Green looked directly at you, Sonia. "We need you to help us reduce air pollution in the city."

Sonia, you have a special task! You need to decide what actions to take to help reduce air pollution. Do you:

A) Tell your parents to use public transportation or walk/bike to school
B) Encourage your friends to plant more trees and flowers in the city
C) Help your family reduce energy consumption by turning off lights and electronics when not in use
