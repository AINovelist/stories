**Introduction**

**Hello, Javid!** Do you know what makes the sky look yucky and gray sometimes? It's because of something called air pollution! Just like how you keep your toys clean and tidy, we need to keep our air clean too!

**Story**
---------

Once upon a time, in a city just like yours, Javid, there lived a little rabbit named Remy. Remy loved to play outside, but she noticed that the air didn't smell very fresh. She saw big trucks and cars driving by, making yucky fumes that made it hard to breathe.

One day, Remy decided to go on a mission to make the air cleaner. She packed a bag with some cool tools and said goodbye to her mom. As she walked through the city, she saw many things that were making the air dirty:

*   Cars and trucks driving by, making smoke come out of their backs.
*   Factories that were releasing bad fumes into the air.
*   People littering and not putting their trash in the bin.

Remy knew she had to do something. She took out her trusty notebook and drew a big picture of a clean and beautiful city. She wrote:

**"I want to make our city's air clean and fresh!"**

Then, Remy met a friendly bird named Sam. Sam was flying high in the sky, but she couldn't fly very far because the air was making her wings feel heavy.

"Hello there, little rabbit!" said Sam. "I'm so tired of flying through this yucky air. Can you help me make it cleaner?"

Remy and Sam became the best of friends and started working together. They went to the city hall and met the mayor, who was happy to listen to their ideas.

Here are some choices Remy and Sam suggested to the mayor:

1.  **Plant more trees**: Trees help clean the air, and they're so pretty!
2.  **Use bicycles**: Instead of driving cars, people can use bicycles to get around.
3.  **Turn off lights**: When no one is using them, lights can waste energy and make the air dirty.

Which idea do **you**, Javid, think would help the most?

\[Insert interactive element or ask the child to choose an option]

Let's say you chose **planting more trees**. That's a wonderful idea! Remy and Sam helped plant many trees around the city, and soon the air started to feel fresher.
