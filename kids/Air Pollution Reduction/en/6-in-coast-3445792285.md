**Introduction**
----------------

Hey علی, have you ever noticed how beautiful and fresh the air feels when you're playing on the beach near your home? The salty smell of the sea and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore make it a perfect place to run and play. But do you know that the air we breathe can sometimes get polluted and make it harder for us to breathe?

**Story**
----------

Meet Luna the seagull, who lives on the same coast as you, علی. Luna loves to fly high above the ocean, feeling the wind beneath her wings and taking in the breathtaking views. But one day, she noticed that it was getting harder to breathe, and the air didn't feel as fresh as it used to.

"Something is wrong!" Luna thought to herself. She decided to investigate and find out what was causing the air pollution. As she flew over the coast, she saw cars and factories releasing yucky smoke into the air.

Luna knew she had to do something to help clean the air. She met a friendly fisherman who told her about the simple things people can do to reduce air pollution. "We can start by reducing, reusing, and recycling," he said.

Here are some things Luna learned:

* **Reduce**: Use public transport, walk, or bike whenever possible.
* **Reuse**: Use bags and containers instead of disposable ones.
* **Recycle**: Sort trash and recyclables to help keep the air clean.

But Luna also knew that she needed your help, علی! She asked for your assistance in spreading the word about reducing air pollution.

**What would you like to do first, علی?**

Do you want to:
A) Create posters to spread awareness about air pollution
B) Help Luna pick up trash on the beach
C) Plant some trees to help clean the air

Remember, every small action counts, and together we can make a big difference. Keep spreading the word, and soon we'll have cleaner air to breathe and a healthier planet to enjoy!

*Recall the 3Rs: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and add one more: Respect our planet!*
