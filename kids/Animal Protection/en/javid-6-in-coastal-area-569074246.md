### Story
Imagine you're walking along the beach, feeling the sand between your toes and the salty air in your hair. You see a little *sea turtle* trying to cross the sand to reach the ocean. But, oh no! There's trash scattered all over the beach, and the turtle might get hurt. 
* What do you think you should do to help the turtle?
1. Pick up the trash to make a clear path for the turtle.
2. Build a sandcastle to block the turtle's way.
3. Go swimming and leave the turtle alone.

As you clean up the beach, you notice **many plastic bottles, bags, and straws** that can harm not just the turtle but also other animals. You realize that **reducing waste** and **recycling** are important steps in protecting marine life.

As you continue your walk, you see a *dolphin* swimming in the distance. It's playing with a **seagull** in the waves. But then, the dolphin gets tangled in a **fishing net**. 
* What can you do to help the dolphin?
1. Try to pull the net off the dolphin.
2. Call for a grown-up to help.
3. Swim away and leave the dolphin.

Let's choose option 2: Call for a grown-up to help. You quickly run to find a lifeguard or a fisherman who can safely rescue the dolphin. They use special tools to carefully remove the net, and the dolphin is finally free!
