**Introduction**
---------------

Hello علی! Imagine you are playing in the green fields surrounding your village, watching the birds fly freely and the butterflies dance around the colorful flowers. But have you ever wondered what happens when these beautiful creatures need our help?

**Story**
---------

 jedné sunny afternoon, while علی was exploring the outskirts of the village, he stumbled upon a small, injured bird. The bird had a broken wing and couldn't fly. علی knew he had to help the bird, but he wasn't sure how.

"Hey there, little bird! What happened to you?" علی asked, concern etched on his face.

The bird looked up at علی with sad eyes and said, *please help me, I need to get back to my nest.*

To help the bird, علی decided to visit his best friend, Dr. Hakim, the village's animal doctor. Dr. Hakim examined the bird and said, **"The bird needs a safe place to rest and recover. We must build a special nest for it."**

But they needed some materials to build the nest. Here are some options:

*   Collect dry leaves and twigs from the forest.
*   Use old, soft cloth from home.
*   Gather some soft feathers from the nearby farm.

What do you think علی should choose?

(Note: At this point, the child can suggest one of the options, and the story can proceed accordingly.)

Let's say علی chose to collect dry leaves and twigs from the forest. With the help of Dr. Hakim, they carefully collected the materials and built a cozy nest for the bird.

**Conclusion**
--------------

As the bird recovered, علی realized that even small actions can make a big difference in the lives of animals. **We can all be kind to animals and help protect them**.

Here are some ways you can help, just like علی:

*   **Give food and water to the animals in your village**.
*   **Tell your friends and family about the importance of animal protection**.
*   **Plant more trees and flowers to create a safe habitat for animals**.

You, too, can be a hero like علی and help protect the animals in your village. Remember, every small action can make a big difference!
