**Animal Guardians of the Mountain**
=====================================

**Introduction**
---------------

In the heart of a majestic mountain range, where towering peaks touched the sky and verdant forests carpeted the slopes, there lived a bright and adventurous boy named ماهان (Mahan). Mahan loved nothing more than exploring the mountains, discovering hidden streams, and watching the wildlife that inhabited this magical realm. One day, while wandering through a dense thicket, Mahan stumbled upon a small, injured bird. This unexpected encounter sparked a remarkable journey that would change Mahan's life forever.

**Story**
----------

As Mahan carefully picked up the bird, he noticed that its wing was badly hurt. He knew he had to act quickly to save the bird's life. Mahan remembered learning about a group of animal guardians who lived in the mountains, dedicated to protecting and caring for the wildlife. He decided to seek their help.

After a short trek, Mahan arrived at the guardians' secluded hideout, a cozy cabin nestled between two giant trees. An elderly guardian named protector, Maya, warmly welcomed Mahan and examined the injured bird. Maya explained that the bird, whose name was Skye, was a valuable member of their ecosystem and needed special care to recover.

Maya proposed that Mahan help her with Skye's rehabilitation process. Mahan eagerly agreed and together they created a makeshift sanctuary within the cabin. As they cared for Skye, Maya shared fascinating facts about the importance of animal protection and the interconnectedness of all living beings.

However, a sudden threat loomed over the mountains. A fierce storm was approaching, and the guardians were worried about the safety of the animals. Maya explained to Mahan that the storm could destroy the animals' habitats and disrupt the delicate balance of the ecosystem.

Here, Mahan faces a challenge:

**Decision Time**

A) Help Maya evacuate the animals to a safer area.
B) Assist Maya in building a stronger shelter for the animals.
C) Join Maya on a mission to clear the nearby streams of debris.
