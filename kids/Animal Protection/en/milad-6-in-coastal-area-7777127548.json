One day, while feeding ducks at the pond, he saw a little bird with a plastic bag wrapped around its leg. Milad wondered, \"Why do animals get hurt by things people throw away?\" He wanted to help keep all animals safe and happy. What could Milad do?"

He remembered seeing lots of trash like plastic bags, bottles, and cans thrown on the ground. His mom had told him that these can harm animals who might accidentally eat them or get tangled up in them. Milad decided he wanted to clean up the park but wasn't sure where to start. Should he pick up all the big pieces of trash himself, ask his friends to help him collect smaller bits like bottle caps and straws, or tell a grown-up so they could organize a bigger cleanup event? What does Milad choose to do first?"

We have to help the animals!\" he exclaimed. His mom listened carefully as Milad explained how he wanted to clean up the park so no more birds would get hurt by trash. She smiled proudly at her thoughtful son and said, \"That's a wonderful idea, Milad! Let's go talk to Mr. Thompson, the park ranger.\" Together, they found Mr. Thompson and told him about Milad's wish to clean up the park. Mr. Thompson was impressed with Milad's concern for animal protection and offered to provide gloves and special bins for collecting different kinds of waste if they organized a community cleanup event next weekend. With excitement sparkling in his eyes, Milad agreed it was exactly what they needed – many hands working together could really make a difference!"
