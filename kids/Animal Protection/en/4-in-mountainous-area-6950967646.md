**Introduction**
================

Hello آدرین! Do you love playing outside in the mountains? Today, we're going on a fun adventure to learn about animal protection. Are you ready?

**Story**
=======

Once upon a time, in a beautiful mountainous area, آدرین loved to play outside and explore. One day, while playing near a stream, آدرین saw a little bird with a broken wing. The bird couldn't fly and was all alone.

آدرین's friend, a wise old rabbit named Remy, appeared and said, *"آدرین, this little bird needs our help. We must be kind and take care of it.*"

Remy explained that many animals in the mountains need our protection. *We must respect their homes and keep them safe.*

Now, آدرین had to make a decision:

A) Take the bird to a nearby nest
B) Give the bird some food and water
C) Build a shelter for the bird

What would you like آدرین to do?

(Note: Please choose one of the options, and I'll continue the story accordingly.)

**Let's choose option B) Give the bird some food and water**

Remy said, *"That's a great idea, آدرین! The bird needs food and water to get strong again.*" آدرین and Remy found some fresh berries and water from the stream and gently fed the bird.

The bird started to feel better, and soon it could fly again! The bird was so happy and thanked آدرین and Remy for their kindness.

**Conclusion**
==========

آدرین learned that even small actions can make a big difference in the lives of animals. We must respect and protect all living creatures, especially those who need our help.

آدرین, you can be a kind and caring friend to animals in the mountains too! Remember, every small act of kindness can make a big difference.

*What can you do today to help animals in your area?*

Think about it, and let's make a plan to be an animal hero like آدرین!
