### Introduction
Hello نینوش, let's go on an adventure! Do you like animals? In the beautiful mountain region where you live, there are many friendly creatures that need our help. Let's explore and learn how we can protect them.

### Story
Imagine you are in a forest near your home, surrounded by tall trees and the sound of birds chirping. Suddenly, you see a little rabbit who is lost. The rabbit tells you that its home is in danger because of litter and dirty water. What can you do to help?
* You can pick up the litter and put it in a bin.
* You can help clean the river by not throwing waste into it.
* You can tell your friends and family to respect the animals' homes.

Let's choose to pick up the litter and put it in a bin. As you do this, more animals start to appear, like birds, squirrels, and even a deer! They all thank you for helping to keep their homes clean. The little rabbit is so happy that it asks you to be its friend and shows you all the secret places in the forest.

### Conclusion
**You are a hero, نینوش!** Every small action you take can help protect the animals and keep the mountain region beautiful. Remember, *we must respect and care for all creatures* because they are our friends. From now on, let's make a habit of keeping our environment clean and safe for everyone. You can start by telling your family and friends about the importance of animal protection and encouraging them to join you in keeping the mountains clean. Keep exploring, learning, and being kind to all the wonderful animals around you!
