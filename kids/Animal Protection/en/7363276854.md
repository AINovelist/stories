**Introduction**
===============

Hello Baran! Imagine you are in a bustling city, surrounded by tall buildings and busy streets. But, have you ever wondered what happens to the animals that live in our city? Let's go on an adventure to find out!

**Story**
=======

One sunny Saturday morning, you decided to visit the local city park with your best friend, a curious and adventurous squirrel named Squeaky. As you were exploring the park, you stumbled upon a small, injured bird lying on the ground. The bird had a broken wing and couldn't fly.

Squeaky, being the quick-thinking squirrel that she is, suggested that you both take the bird to the nearby animal shelter. When you arrived at the shelter, you met a kind and knowledgeable staff member named Ms. Jasmine. She explained that the bird's wing could be healed with proper care and attention.

Ms. Jasmine told you that many animals in the city face similar challenges, such as habitat loss, pollution, and lack of food. She asked for your help in making the city a better place for animals. You and Squeaky were eager to help!

Here are some challenges the animals in the city face:

* **Pollution**: Animals get sick from eating trash and breathing polluted air.
* **Habitat Loss**: Buildings and roads destroy animal homes and habitats.
* **Food Scarcity**: Animals struggle to find food in the city.

Ms. Jasmine gave you a map of the city with three locations marked. She asked you to choose which location to visit first:

1. **The City Park**: Help clean up the park and plant animal-friendly plants.
2. **The Community Garden**: Assist in creating a garden that provides food for local animals.
3. **The Animal Shelter**: Help care for injured animals like the bird you rescued.

**What would you like to do first, Baran?**

(Note: Please choose one of the options above, and I'll continue the story accordingly.)
