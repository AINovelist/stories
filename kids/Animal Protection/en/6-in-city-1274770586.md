**Introduction**
===============

Hello علی! Today, we're going to go on an exciting adventure in the city to learn about something very important: **Animal Protection**. Are you ready to join me?

**Story**
======

One sunny day in the city, علی was playing in the park when he heard a faint meowing sound coming from a nearby bush. As he approached, he saw a little kitten trapped behind a pile of boxes. The kitten looked scared and hungry.

علی knew he had to help the kitten. He gently picked it up and cradled it in his arms. The kitten started to purr, and علی felt happy that he could help.

As he was about to take the kitten home, he met a friendly park ranger, Mrs. Rana. She was thrilled to see علی rescuing the kitten. "Great job, علی!" she exclaimed. "Animal protection is everyone's responsibility, especially in the city where animals can easily get lost or hurt."

Mrs. Rana explained that the kitten's mother might be looking for it, so they decided to work together to find her. They put up posters around the park, asked people if they had seen the mother cat, and even used a special app to locate lost pets.

After some time, they received a message from someone who had spotted the mother cat in a nearby alley. They rushed to the alley and were overjoyed to see the mother cat reunited with her kitten.

**Conclusion**
==========

Regardless of the chosen action, aquí Rana will guide علی through the proper steps to help the bird.

Mrs. Rana would advise against touching the bird, as it might cause more harm. Instead, she would show علی how to carefully observe the bird from a safe distance and call a local animal rescue team for assistance.

By working together,áli and Mrs. Rana would help the bird receive the necessary care and attention.

As the sun sets in the city, علی learns a valuable lesson: **Every small action can make a big difference in animal protection**. By being kind and responsible, we can create a safer and happier environment for
