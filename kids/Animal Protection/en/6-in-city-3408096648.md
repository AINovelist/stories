**Introduction**
Hello Tiwa! Today, we're going on an adventure to learn about animal protection. Are you ready to meet a new friend who will take us on a fun journey?

**Story**

Once upon a time, in a city not so far from yours, there lived a kind and gentle rabbit named Rosie. Rosie loved making new friends, especially children who cared about animals. One sunny day, Tiwa, you met Rosie in a park near your home. Rosie was delighted to meet you and decided to take you on a mission to help protect the animals in the city.

Rosie explained that many animals in the city need our help. They either get lost, hurt, or don't have enough food. Tiwa, do you want to help Rosie:

A) Visit a local animal shelter to see how we can help animals in need?
B) Go on a park clean-up to make sure animals have a clean and safe place to live?
C) Help Rosie create a bird feeder to provide food for the birds?

Choose your answer:

(If Tiwa chooses A, the story will continue with the animal shelter visit. If Tiwa chooses B, the story will continue with the park clean-up. If Tiwa chooses C, the story will continue with creating a bird feeder.)

Let's say Tiwa chooses A) Visit a local animal shelter.

As you visit the animal shelter with Rosie, you see many animals waiting for a forever home. Rosie explains that the shelter needs our help to take care of these furry friends. You and Rosie help the staff clean the cages, feed the animals, and play with them. You learn that every small action can make a big difference in the lives of these animals.

But then, you hear a sad cry from a little kitten. The kitten is scared and misses its mother. Rosie asks for your help:

* What do you think we can do to make the kitten feel better?

(Tiwa can provide their answer, and the story will continue accordingly.)

Let's say Tiwa says, "We can play with the kitten and give it a toy to comfort it."

That's a wonderful idea, Tiwa! You and Rosie play with the kitten and give it a soft toy. The kitten starts to purr and feels a bit better. Rosie explains that sometimes, all animals need is a little love and care.

**Conclusion**

Tiwa, you made a big difference in the lives of the animals at the shelter today. Remember, every small action we take can help protect and care
