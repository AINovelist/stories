--------------------------------

Hello Arthur! Today, you're going to go on a fantastic journey to learn about protecting our furry friends in the suburbs. Are you excited?

**Story**
=========

Arthur loved playing in his suburban backyard, surrounded by trees, birds, and squirrels. One sunny afternoon, while riding his bike, he heard a faint meowing sound coming from a nearby bush.

As he approached the bush, he found a tiny kitten, no more than a few weeks old, cowering in fear. The little ball of fur had big green eyes and soft, fluffy whiskers. Arthur's heart melted, and he gently picked up the kitten.

"What should I do, Mom?" Arthur asked, running back to his house with the kitten.

His mom suggested they take the kitten to a local animal shelter, where it could get food, water, and love until its owner was found.

At the shelter, Arthur met Mrs. Whiskers, a kind volunteer who took care of the animals. She showed Arthur all the amazing work they did to help animals in need.

But then, Mrs. Whiskers shared a problem with Arthur: the shelter was running out of food and supplies! Arthur wanted to help, but he wasn't sure how.

**What do you think Arthur should do?**

* A) Ask his friends to donate their toys to the shelter
* B) Help Mrs. Whiskers organize a bake sale to raise money
* C) Go door-to-door in his neighborhood to collect pet food
