Ali loved playing in the suburbs, exploring the parks and gardens near his home. One sunny afternoon, while wandering through a nearby park, Ali stumbled upon a small, furry creature hiding behind a bush.

"Hello there, little one!" Ali exclaimed. "What's wrong? Why are you hiding?"

The creature looked up, and Ali saw that it was a beautiful, young rabbit with big brown eyes.

"I'm scared," the rabbit said in a trembling voice. "I lost my way from my family's burrow. I don't know how to find them."

Ali's heart melted at the rabbit's words. He wanted to help.

"Don't worry, I'll help you find your family," Ali said, smiling. "But first, let's make sure you're safe. We need to check if there are any dangers around us."

As they looked around, Ali noticed that the park was filled with plastic bags, discarded food wrappers, and other trash.

**Continuation of the Story**

※ note: I will choose answer B, looking for a grown-up for help.

Ali and the rabbit decided to look for a grown-up to help. They walked together until they found a park ranger, who was busy planting flowers.

"Excuse me, sir!" Ali called out. "We need your help. This little rabbit is lost, and we need to find its family. Also, there's a lot of trash in the park. Can you help us clean it up?"

The park ranger smiled and said, "Of course, we can help! Let's first find the rabbit's family, and then we'll clean up the trash together."
