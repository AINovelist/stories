Given the topic of animal protection, our goal is to engage him while teaching valuable lessons.\n\n## Step 2: Creating Page 1 - The Curious Question\nFor a curious 4-year-old like Milad living in the city, encountering animals might not be as common as it would be for someone living closer to nature. However, cities have parks and zoos where kids can interact with or learn about various species. Our starting point could involve Milad visiting a local zoo or park and noticing something concerning related to animal welfare.\n\nExample Content for Page 1:\n\"The Curious Question\"\nMilad visited the city zoo one sunny day.
