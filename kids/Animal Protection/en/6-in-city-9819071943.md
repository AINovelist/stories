### Introduction
Hello نیکان, let's go on an exciting adventure! Do you know what happens to animals when they get lost in the city? Today, we're going to explore how we can help protect them. 

### Story
Imagine you're walking home from school in your city when you hear a faint meowing sound coming from a nearby alley. As you get closer, you see a *tiny kitten* trapped behind a big dumpster. The kitten looks scared and alone. You want to help it, but you're not sure how. 

Here are a few options to help the kitten:
* Call a grown-up for assistance
* Try to move the dumpster by yourself
* Leave the kitten and come back later with food

If you choose to **call a grown-up**, a kind *animal shelter worker* named Ms. Rahimi arrives with her team. They safely rescue the kitten and take it to the shelter for care. Ms. Rahimi explains that many animals get lost in the city and need our help to find their way back home or to a safe place.

If you decide to **try to move the dumpster**, you realize it's too heavy, and you might get hurt. But you don't give up! You think about what you can do instead. You remember seeing a *community garden* nearby where people often work together on projects. You run to the garden and ask for help. Together, you and the gardeners manage to move the dumpster and rescue the kitten safely.

If you choose to **leave the kitten**, you can't stop thinking about it. You decide to go back with some food and water. When you return, you're relieved to find the kitten still there. You feed it and give it water, but you know it needs more help. You then call Ms. Rahimi, and she comes to take the kitten to the shelter.

In all cases, the kitten ends up safe, thanks to your actions! Ms. Rahimi tells you that there are many ways to help animals in the city, such as:
- Reporting lost or injured animals to shelters
- Participating in local clean-up events to reduce harm to wildlife
- Learning more about urban animals and how to peacefully coexist with them

### Conclusion
نیکان, you're a hero for wanting to help the kitten! Every small action you take can make a big difference in the lives of animals living in the city. Remember, **you have the power to protect and care for animals**. Always look out
