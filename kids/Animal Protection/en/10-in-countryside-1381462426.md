### Story
You're walking through a beautiful meadow, surrounded by tall grass and colorful flowers. Suddenly, you hear a faint cry for help. You follow the sound and find a little bird with a broken wing.

There's a family of rabbits whose burrows are being destroyed, a squirrel who can't find any nuts due to deforestation, and a hedgehog who's getting hurt by litter. You realize that every small action you take can help these animals. You start a **recycling program** in your community, encourage your friends to **plant more trees**, and organize a **clean-up day** in the forest. 

### Conclusion
