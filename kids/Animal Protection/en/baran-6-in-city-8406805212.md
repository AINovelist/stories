**Introduction**
================

Hello Baran! Today, we're going on an exciting adventure in our city to learn about animal protection. Are you ready to meet a special friend who will help us on our journey?

**Story**
=========

One sunny day in the city, Baran was playing in the park when he heard a faint meowing sound coming from a nearby bush. As he approached, he saw a tiny kitten trapped behind a pile of branches. Baran immediately wanted to help the kitten, but he wasn't sure how.

 Luckily, a friendly squirrel named Squeaky appeared from nowhere. "Hello, Baran! I see you're trying to help this little kitten. That's very kind of you," said Squeaky.

Baran explained the situation, and Squeaky suggested they work together to set the kitten free. They gently lifted the branches, and the kitten scampered out, purring happily.

The kitten's owner, a kind old woman, was extremely grateful to Baran and Squeaky. She told them that the kitten's name was Whiskers and that she was very lucky to have such caring friends.

Squeaky then explained to Baran that many animals in the city need our help and protection. "We can start by keeping our park clean, providing food and water for the birds, and being kind to all creatures we meet," said Squeaky.

Baran thought for a moment and asked, "But Squeaky, what can I do to help animals like Whiskers?"

Squeaky smiled and said, "Let's make a list of ways we can help animals in our city!"

Here's what Baran and Squeaky came up with:

*   Keep our park clean by throwing away trash and recyclables.
*   Provide food and water for the birds by filling the bird feeders and birdbaths.
*   Be kind to all creatures by respecting their homes and not disturbing them.
*   Tell our friends and family about the importance of animal protection.

**Conclusion**
==============

Baran realized that even small actions can make a big difference in the lives of animals like Whiskers. From that day on, Baran and Squeaky became inseparable friends, working together to protect and care for the animals in their city.
