**Introduction**
===============

Hello آدرین! Do you know what makes our city a happy and healthy place to live? It's the trees! They give us shade, fresh air, and a home for our friends, the birds. But did you know that trees need our help to stay strong and healthy?

**Story**
ט

Once upon a time, in a city just like yours, آدرین, there was a little tree named Terry. Terry loved making new friends and playing with the children in the city. But as time went by, Terry started to feel sad. People would throw trash on the ground, and cars would make a lot of noise, making it hard for Terry to sleep.

One day, a big windstorm came to the city, and Terry's leaves started to fall off. The children who played with Terry were worried that she might get hurt. That's when a friendly squirrel named Squeaky came to help.

Squeaky said, "We need to take care of Terry! We can pick up the trash, water her roots, and give her lots of love." The children worked together to help Terry. They picked up the trash, watered her roots, and even sang a happy song to make her feel better.

But now it's your turn, آدرین! Terry needs your help too!

What do you think we can do to help Terry?

A) Plant more trees in the city
B) Give Terry a big hug
C) Pick up the trash that hurts Terry
D) Sing a happy song to Terry

**Choose your answer:**

(Note: Please choose one of the above options, and I'll continue the story accordingly.)

**Conclusion**
==============

You chose **C) Pick up the trash that hurts Terry**! That's a great choice, آدرین! By picking up the trash, we can keep Terry's home clean and safe.

Terry was so happy and grateful for the children's help. She started to grow new leaves, and her branches became stronger. The children continued to take care of Terry, and soon, more trees started to grow in the city.

آدرین, you can also help take care of the trees in your city. Remember to:

* **Pick up the trash** when you see it on the ground
* **Plant more trees** with your family and friends
* **Give trees a big hug** by being kind to them
