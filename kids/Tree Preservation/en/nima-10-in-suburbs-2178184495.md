**Introduction**
===============

Hi Nima! Imagine you are in a magical forest filled with tall, green trees that stretch up to the sky. The trees provide shade, produce oxygen, and are home to various animals. Can you think of ways trees help us and our environment?

**Story**
=========

You are on a summer vacation in the suburbs, exploring the woods behind your house. As you wander through the forest, you come across a wise old owl perched on a tree branch. The owl introduces herself as Professor Hootenanny.

"Hello, Nima!" says Professor Hootenanny. "I've been watching you, and I see you have a keen interest in nature. The trees in our forest are in trouble. Many of them are being cut down for urban development, and it's harming the ecosystem. We need your help to save them."

Professor Hootenanny hands you a map with three locations marked. "These are the areas where the trees are in danger. We need to decide which one to save first. The blue location has the oldest trees, the green location has the most endangered species, and the red location has the most trees being cut down."

You look at the map and think about what to do. **What do you want to do, Nima?**

* Do you want to save the oldest trees (blue location)?
* Do you want to save the location with the most endangered species (green location)?
* Do you want to stop the cutting down of trees immediately (red location)?
