آدرین loves playing outside in the city, but have you ever wondered, آدرین, why trees are important in our city?

**Story**
=========

آدرین's Tree Friends
--------------------

One sunny day, آدرین was playing in the park when she saw a big, beautiful tree with colorful leaves. Suddenly, a friendly squirrel named Squeaky popped out from behind the tree.

"Hello آدرین! My name is Squeaky. I live in this tree with my family," said Squeaky.

*Squeaky showed آدرین all the different types of animals that lived in and around the tree, like birds, insects, and even a family of rabbits.*

"Wow, so many friends live in this tree!" exclaimed آدرین.

But then, a strong wind started blowing, and some of the leaves began to fall.

"Oh no! Our tree is losing its leaves!" cried Squeaky.

آدرین and Squeaky worked together to pick up the leaves and put them back on the tree. As they worked, Squeaky explained why trees are important:

* **Trees give us oxygen to breathe**
* **Trees provide homes for animals**
* **Trees keep our city clean and pretty**

آدرین was so happy to help her new friends and promised to take care of the tree.
