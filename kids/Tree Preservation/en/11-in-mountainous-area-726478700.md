**Introduction**
================

In the majestic mountains where the air is crisp and the trees stand tall, a young adventurer named **Mahān** loved to explore. Mahān's curiosity and love for nature often led him to the forests surrounding his village. One day, while wandering through the woods, Mahān stumbled upon a hidden path he had never seen before.

As Mahān walked down the winding path, the canopy of trees grew denser, and the scent of pine filled the air. Suddenly, a soft voice whispered, *“Mahān, follow me.”* A gentle breeze rustled the leaves, and a small, furry creature with big, round eyes appeared before him. It was a wise old owl named Olwen, who had been watching Mahān from afar.
