Hello Parsa! Do you know what makes the countryside so beautiful and fresh? It's the **trees** that surround your home. Trees are like nature's superheroes, providing us with oxygen, shade, and homes for animals. But have you ever wondered what happens when trees are cut down or hurt? Let's go on an adventure to learn more about **tree preservation** and how you can be a hero for the trees.

### Story
Imagine you are playing in a forest near your countryside home when you meet a friendly **squirrel** named Squeaky. Squeaky tells you that many trees in the forest are in danger because of pollution, cutting, and lack of water. The animals are worried about their homes and need your help.

  1. Give it water
  2. Plant more trees around it

* You find out that some people are cutting down trees to build houses. What can you suggest to them?
  1. Build houses in the city instead
  2. Plant new trees for every tree cut down
  3. Use materials that don't harm trees
* You notice that the forest floor is filled with trash. What do you do?
  1. Pick up the trash and recycle it
  2. Ask your friends to help clean the forest
  3. Tell the animals to be more careful

You choose to give the dry tree water, suggest planting new trees for every tree cut down, and pick up the trash to recycle it. Squeaky and the other animals are very proud of you for making these choices. With your help, the forest starts to heal, and the trees become strong and healthy again.
