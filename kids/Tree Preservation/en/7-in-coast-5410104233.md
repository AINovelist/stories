**Introduction**
================================

Hello ماهان! Let's go on an adventure in the beautiful coastal town where you live. Do you know what makes your town so special? It's the wonderful trees that line the streets and provide shade for you to play under. But have you ever thought about what would happen if these trees disappeared?

**Story**
==========

อนeday, ماهان decided to explore the nearby forest with his best friend, a wise old owl named Olwen. As they wandered through the trees, Olwen told ماهان about the importance of tree preservation.

"Imagine if all these trees were gone, ماهان," Olwen said, flapping her wings. "The coast would be so different. The trees help keep the sand in place, provide homes for animals, and even help clean the air we breathe!"

As they continued their journey, they came across a small clearing where a group of children were planting new trees.

 "*Wow, what are they doing?*" ماهان asked Olwen.

"They're helping to restore the forest and make sure the trees keep growing strong," Olwen replied.

But suddenly, a strong gust of wind blew, and a small tree sapling began to fall over. The children cried out in distress.

**What do you think ماهان should do?**

*   Try to lift the sapling back up
*   Call for help from the other children
*   Find some rope to tie the sapling in place
*   Leave it, it's not a big deal

Choose a response, and we'll see what happens next...

*Mahan chose to find some rope to tie the sapling in place.*

Olwen was proud of ماهان's quick thinking. Together, they tied the sapling securely, and the children cheered.

The group leader, a kind old man named Mr. Kamal, thanked ماهان for his help. "You're a true tree hero, ماهان! Every small action we take to protect our trees makes a big difference."

As they continued their walk, Olwen pointed out the different types of trees they saw. "Look, ماهان! That's a mangrove tree, and over there is a cedar. Each one has its own special job in keeping our coast healthy."

**Conclusion**
==============

Mahan learned that even small actions can make a big difference in protecting the trees and the coastal environment. He realized that every tree is special and important in its own way.

*Mahan decided to share what he learned with his friends and family and
