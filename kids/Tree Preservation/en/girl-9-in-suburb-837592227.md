**Introduction**
===============

Hey عاطفه! Have you ever wondered why trees are so important to our planet? Let's go on an adventure to find out!

**Story**
=======

Once upon a time, in a beautiful suburb not so different from yours, there was a magical tree named Olwen. Olwen was a magnificent oak tree with branches that stretched towards the sky and roots that dug deep into the earth. She stood tall in the heart of the suburb, providing shade for the children to play, homes for the birds to nest, and oxygen for everyone to breathe.

One sunny day, عاطفه, you were playing near Olwen when you noticed that she looked a bit sad. Her leaves were wilting, and her trunk was covered in trash. You asked Olwen, "What's wrong?" Olwen replied, "I'm struggling to survive because of human actions. People are cutting down trees, polluting the air, and littering the ground. I need your help, عاطفه!"

**The Challenge**
----------------

Olwen gave you three options to help her:

*   **Clean up the trash**: Pick up the litter and put it in the recycling bin.
*   **Plant new trees**: Help plant new trees in the empty spaces around the suburb.
*   **Tell others**: Spread the word about the importance of tree preservation and the harm of pollution.

Which option do you choose, عاطفه?

**Conclusion**
==========

Congratulations, عاطفه! You chose to clean up the trash and plant new trees. With your help, Olwen regained her strength, and the suburb became a cleaner and greener place.

*   **Every small action counts**: Your decision to clean up the trash and plant new trees made a significant difference in preserving Olwen and the environment.
*   **We can all be tree guardians**: Just like you, everyone can contribute to protecting trees and the environment.
*   **Spread the word**: Share what you've learned with your friends and family, and encourage them to join you in preserving the beauty of nature.

Remember, عاطفه, taking care of our environment is a collective responsibility. Every small action you take can make a big difference. Keep being a tree guardian and inspiring others to do the same!
