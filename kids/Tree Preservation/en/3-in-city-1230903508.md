**Title:** آدرین and the Little Tree
====================================

**Introduction:**
---------------

Hey آدرین! Do you know what makes our city a happier place? Trees! They give us shade, oxygen, and make everything look beautiful. But sometimes, we need to take care of them so they can keep making our city happy. Let's go on an adventure and learn how to be a tree's best friend!

**Story:**
----------

آدرین loved playing in the city park near her home. One day, while playing with her ball, she saw a little tree with a few leaves. The tree looked sad and had a sign that said, "Please don't hurt me!"

آدرین asked, "Mommy, why is the tree sad?" Her mom replied, "The tree needs water, and the city is very hot. We need to take care of it so it can grow big and strong!" 

آدرین wanted to help. She asked her mom, "What can I do to make the tree happy?" Her mom said, "We can water it, and you can also draw a picture to make the tree feel special."

آدرین drew a beautiful picture of a smiling tree with lots of green leaves and colorful flowers. She taped the picture to the tree and gave it a big hug!

But then, strong winds came, and the tree started to sway. The sign on the tree fell off, and آدرین was worried. She thought, "What if the tree falls down?"

Her mom suggested, "Let's work together to find a solution. What do you think we can do to help the tree?"

Do you have an idea to help آدرین and the little tree?

*   **Water the tree**: We can water the tree regularly to keep it strong.
*   **Plant more trees**: We can plant more trees around the little tree to block the strong winds.
*   **Use a rope**: We can tie a rope around the tree to keep it safe.
