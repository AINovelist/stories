**Introduction**
================

Hello آدرین! Do you know what makes our city a happy place to live? It's the beautiful trees that surround us! Trees are like big, green friends that provide shade, fresh air, and homes for birds and squirrels. But have you ever wondered what happens when trees are not taken care of?

**Story**
==========

One sunny day, in a park near آدرین's home, a little tree named Terry felt sad. Terry had been planted a few years ago, but lately, people had been throwing trash and hurting his branches. آدرین saw Terry looking unhappy and decided to help.

آدرین picked up a nearby trash can and started collecting the garbage around Terry. "Why are you doing this?" asked a curious squirrel who lived in Terry's branches. آدرین replied, "I want to help Terry feel better!"

The squirrel suggested, "If we water Terry regularly, he'll grow strong and healthy again." آدرین filled a bucket with water and gave Terry a good drink. Terry's leaves started to shine, and he looked happy.

But then, a strong wind came, and Terry's branches swayed. آدرین held Terry's trunk and said, "Don't worry, I've got you!" The squirrel added, "We can also plant more trees around Terry, so he's not alone."

Together, آدرین and the squirrel planted a few more trees and made a promise to take care of them. Terry smiled, feeling grateful for his new friends and the city's help.
