**Introduction**
================

Hello آدرین! Let's go on an adventure in your city! Have you ever seen trees swaying gently in the wind? Trees are our friends and they need our help. Today, we're going to learn about why trees are important and how we can protect them.

**Story**
=========

آدرین loves playing in the city park near her home. One sunny day, she sees a big, beautiful tree with birds chirping on its branches. Suddenly, a strong wind blows, and some leaves fall from the tree. آدرین picks up a leaf and asks, "Mommy, why are the leaves falling?"

Her mom explains, "Leaves fall from trees to make room for new ones. It's a natural process. But sometimes, people can hurt trees by cutting them down or not giving them enough water." آدرین looks concerned and asks, "What can we do to help the trees?"

Her mom smiles and says, "We can plant more trees, give them water, and keep the park clean." آدرین excitedly replies, "I want to help! Can we plant a tree now?"

**Interactive Middle**
--------------------

You can help آدرین decide how to care for the tree. Choose one of the following options:

1. Water the tree with a watering can
2. Pick up trash around the park to keep it clean
3. Plant a new tree with a colorful flower

What would you like to do, آدرین?

(Note: For a physical book, you can include a flap or a pop-up for the interactive element. For a digital version, you can include a tap-to-choose feature.)

**Continuation of the Story**
---------------------------

Let's say آدرین chooses to water the tree. She fills a watering can with water and pours it on the tree's roots. The tree looks happy, and the birds sing a sweet melody.

Now, it's your turn! Help آدرین pick a new tree to plant. Choose one of the following options:

* A fruit tree with juicy apples
* A flower tree with colorful blossoms
* A tall tree with a swing for playing

What kind of tree do you think آدرین should plant?

**Conclusion**
==============

آدرین learns that every small action can help care for the trees. By planting a new tree, she makes the park a happier place for everyone. You can also make a difference, just like آدرین!
