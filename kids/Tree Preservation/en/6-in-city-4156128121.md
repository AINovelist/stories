**Introduction**
===============

Hello علی! Do you know why trees are so important for our city? They give us oxygen, shade, and a home for birds and squirrels. But sometimes, people forget to take care of them. Let's go on an adventure to learn how we can help preserve the trees in our city!

**Story**
=====

_one day, علی was playing in the park when he saw a big, old tree with a sign that said "Please Help Us!"_

	glUniformThe tree, whose name was Olwen, toldعلی that she was feeling sad because people were throwing trash and hurting her branches. علی wanted to help Olwen, but he didn't know how.

*"What can I do to help you, Olwen?"* علی asked.

Olwen replied, *_“I need someone to pick up the trash around me, water my roots, and tell others to respect me.”_

alian thought for a moment and then said, *"I can do that! But I need some help."*

_He ran to the nearby community center and met a friendly park ranger named Ms. Leila. She gave علی a trash bag, a watering can, and a poster that said, "Please Respect Our Trees!"_

Together, علی, Ms. Leila, and Olwen made a plan:

*   They picked up the trash around Olwen and put it in the recycling bin.
*   They watered Olwen's roots to keep her strong.
*   They posted the sign around the park to remind everyone to respect the trees.

As they worked, Ms. Leila taughtعلی about the importance of trees in the city:

*   **Trees provide oxygen** for us to breathe.
*   **Trees give shade** to keep us cool.
*   **Trees are homes** for birds, squirrels, and other animals.

After their hard work, Olwen looked happy and healthy again!

**Conclusion**
==========

Well done, علی! You helped Olwen and learned how to take care of the trees in our city. Remember, every small action can make a big difference. You can help preserve the trees by:

*   **Reducing waste** and recycling.
*   **Respecting** trees' space and not hurting them.
*   **Telling others** about the importance of tree preservation.

Keep being a tree helper like علی, and soon our city will be a greener, happier place!

Happy tree hugging, علی!
