**Introduction**
================

Hello مسعود! Today, we're going on an exciting adventure in the suburbs where you live. Do you know what happens to the trash we throw away every day? Let's dive into a story to find out!

**Story**
=========

Once upon a time, in a sunny suburb, there lived a curious and friendly rabbit named Benny. Benny loved to explore and play in the neighborhood park near his home. One day, while hopping around, he noticed a lot of trash scattered all around the park. He saw plastic bottles, food wrappers, and broken toys. Benny was sad and wanted to help clean up the park.

Benny met a wise old owl named Olwen, who was perched on a tree branch. Olwen asked Benny, "What do you think we can do to keep our park clean?" Benny thought for a moment and said, "I can pick up the trash and put it in the recycling bins!" Olwen smiled and said, "That's a great start! But we need to reduce the amount of waste we produce in the first place."

Olwen explained to Benny that *reducing waste means using less stuff and choosing items that can be reused or recycled*. Benny's eyes widened with excitement. He wanted to help reduce waste in the park and in his own home.

Here are some ways Benny and Olwen reduced waste in the park:

* They picked up trash and sorted it into recycling bins.
* They used reusable bags and containers for snacks and picnics.
* They encouraged their friends to bring refillable water bottles instead of single-use plastic bottles.
