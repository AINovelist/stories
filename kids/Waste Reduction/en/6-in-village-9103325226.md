**Introduction**
===============

Hello جاوید! Let's go on an exciting adventure in your village. Do you know what makes our village beautiful and clean? It's because of the efforts of people like you who care about keeping our environment clean. Today, we're going to talk about something very important: reducing waste. Are you ready to learn and have fun?

**Story**
=========

جاوید loved playing in the village park. One day, while playing with his friends, he noticed that the park was filled with trash. Plastic bags, broken toys, and food wrappers were scattered all around. جاوید asked his friend, "What's happening to our park?"

His friend replied, "I think people are not throwing their trash in the right place." جاوید decided to do something about it. He gathered his friends and said, "Let's clean up the park!"

As they started picking up the trash, they met a friendly squirrel named Squeaky. Squeaky loved living in the park, but she was sad to see it dirty. She asked جاوید and his friends, "Why do you think there's so much trash here?"

جاوید thought for a moment and said, "I think people don't have enough trash cans, and they don't know how to recycle." Squeaky's eyes sparkled and said, "That's correct, جاوید! We need to reduce, reuse, and recycle."

Here are some ways جاوید and his friends reduced waste in the park:

* **Reduce**: They asked the village shopkeepers to use cloth bags instead of plastic bags.
* **Reuse**: They collected old toys and fixed them to give to other children.
* **Recycle**: They put up recycling bins and taught the villagers how to separate paper, plastic, and glass.

Squeaky was so proud of جاوید and his friends. She said, "You're doing a great job! Every small action helps keep our park clean and beautiful."

**Conclusion**
==============

جاوید learned that everyone can make a difference in keeping their community clean. He realized that small actions like reducing, reusing, and recycling can make a big impact. جاوید and his friends continued to take care of the park, and soon it became the cleanest and most beautiful park in the village.

*What can you do today to reduce waste in your community, جاوید?*

Remember, **every small action counts**, and together we can make a difference!
