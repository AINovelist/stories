**Introduction**
===============

Hello جاوید! Do you know what happens to the garbage we throw away every day? Let's go on an adventure to find out!

**Story**
=======

Once upon a time, in a beautiful suburb just like yours, there was a magical garden filled with colorful flowers, buzzing bees, and happy butterflies. The garden was home to a friendly rabbit named Remy, who loved to play and explore.

One day, Remy noticed that the garden was getting messy. There were plastic bottles, broken toys, and wrappers everywhere! Remy asked, "Where did all this trash come from?" A wise old owl replied, "It's from the humans who live in the nearby houses. They throw away things without thinking about where they go."

Remy decided to take action. She asked the humans to help her reduce waste in the garden. But, she needed their help to decide how to do it.

**What do you think جاوید? What should Remy do first?**

A) Ask the humans to sort their trash into different bins.
B) Tell the humans to use reusable bags when they go shopping.
C) Suggest that the humans use both A and B.
