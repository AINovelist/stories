**Introduction**
===============

**Welcome to the Adventures of محسن: The Young Waste Warrior!**
--------------------------------------------------------

Imagine you are محسن, a 5-year-old superhero living in a bustling city. One day, while playing in the park, you notice a lot of trash scattered around the playground. Plastic bottles, crumpled up papers, and discarded food wrappers are spoiling the beautiful green grass. You wonder, "What can I do to help keep our park clean and make our city a better place?"

**Story**
========

**The Mysterious Waste Bin**
-------------------------

As you walk through the park, you stumble upon a magical waste bin with a smiling face. The bin introduces himself as "Sam the Smart Bin." Sam explains that he has been watching you play and is impressed by your curiosity and concern for the environment.

Sam says, "Hey محسن, did you know that every small action you take can make a big difference in keeping our city clean? I need your help to reduce waste and make our park a cleaner place. Are you ready to join me on this adventure?"

**Your Turn!**
--------------

You look at the park and see three types of trash: **Plastic Bottles**, **Old Newspapers**, and **Food Wrappers**. You need to decide which type of trash to collect first.

What would you like to do, محسن?
* Collect the plastic bottles and put them in the recycling bin?
* Pick up the old newspapers and use them to make a paper airplane?
* Gather the food wrappers and throw them away in the regular trash can?

Choose your answer:

**You decide to collect the plastic bottles!**

Sam the Smart Bin cheers, "Great job, محسن! Recycling plastic bottles is an excellent way to reduce waste. For every plastic bottle you recycle, you'll help conserve natural resources and decrease the amount of trash in our landfills."

As you collect the plastic bottles, you notice that the park is starting to look cleaner. You feel proud of yourself and want to continue making a difference.
