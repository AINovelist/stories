**The Adventures of Ali and the Magic Bin**
=============================================

**Introduction**
---------------

Once upon a time, in a small village surrounded by lush green forests and sparkling streams, lived a curious and adventurous six-year-old boy named علی (Ali). Ali loved playing outside and exploring the natural world around him. One day, while wandering through the village, Ali noticed that the streets were filled with trash and waste. He wondered, "What can I do to help keep my village clean?"

**Story**
--------

As Ali walked through the village, he stumbled upon a magical bin hidden behind a tree. The bin had a sign that read: **".usage-reduce-reuse-recycle.**" Suddenly, a friendly voice echoed from within the bin, "Hello, Ali! My name is Eco, and I'm here to help you on a mission to reduce waste in your village."

Eco explained to Ali that the villagers were producing a lot of waste, and it was harming the environment. Ali was determined to help. Eco presented Ali with a challenge:

"We need to collect three types of waste from around the village: paper, plastic, and glass. Can you help me sort them correctly and teach the villagers about the importance of waste reduction?"

Ali eagerly accepted the challenge. Together, Ali and Eco set out on their mission.

As they walked, they came across various villagers. Ali met a farmer who was about to throw away a plastic bottle. Ali said, "Excuse me, sir! Can I help you find a better way to dispose of that bottle?" The farmer smiled and handed Ali the bottle. Ali and Eco sorted it into the correct bin.

Next, they met a teacher who was about to throw away a stack of paper cards. Ali asked, "Can we reuse these cards instead of throwing them away?" The teacher was impressed and handed Ali the cards.

Ali and Eco continued their journey, meeting various villagers and teaching them about the importance of waste reduction. With each successful sorting, the magic bin glowed brighter.
