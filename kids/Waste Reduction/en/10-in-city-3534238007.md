**Introduction**
=================

Meet مهناز, a 10-year-old city girl who loves playing with her friends and exploring the outdoors. One day, while walking home from school, مهناز noticed that her favorite park was filled with trash. She saw plastic bottles, food wrappers, and old newspapers scattered all over the grass. مهناز felt sad and wondered, "What can I do to help keep our park clean?"

**Story**
==========

مهناز decided to talk to her best friend, a wise old owl named Olwen. Olwen lived in a tree near the park and had seen the changes in the environment over the years.

"Olwen, have you seen the state of our park?" مهناز asked, pointing to the trash.

Olwen looked at مهناز with her big, round eyes and said, "*Yes, I have. It's a big problem. But I know we can make a change.*"

Olwen explained to مهناز that *waste reduction* is one of the simplest ways to help the environment. "We can reduce, reuse, and recycle," Olwen said. "Let's make a plan to reduce waste in our park and our city."

مهناز and Olwen decided to take action. They organized a *cleanup day* and invited their friends to join. Together, they picked up trash, sorted recyclables, and made a big difference.

As they worked, مهناز asked Olwen, "What can we do to reduce waste every day?"

Olwen replied, "We can start by reducing our use of single-use plastics, like straws and bags. We can also reuse containers and bottles. And, of course, we must recycle as much as possible."

Here are some ways مهناز and her friends can reduce waste:

* Bring reusable bags and containers when shopping
* Use a refillable water bottle
* Avoid single-use plastics, like straws and cutlery
* Recycle paper, plastic, and glass

**Conclusion**
==============

مهناز and her friends made a big impact on their park and their community. They learned that every small action can make a big difference. مهناز realized that she has the power to reduce waste and protect the environment.

*You* can be like مهناز too! Remember, every time you make a choice to reduce, reuse, or recycle, you are helping to keep our planet clean and healthy.
