**جاوید and the Magical Village**
=====================================

### Introduction

Hello جاوید! Do you know what happens to the trash we throw away in our village? Let's go on an adventure to find out!

### Story

One sunny day, جاوید decided to explore the village and see where all the trash goes. He walked past the marketplace, where vendors were selling fresh fruits and vegetables. He saw people throwing away plastic bags, food wrappers, and broken toys. جاوید wondered, "Where does all this trash go?"

As he walked further, he met a friendly earthworm named **Wiggle**. Wiggle said, "Hello, جاوید! I've been living in this soil for a long time, and I've seen a lot of trash hurting our environment. Would you like to help me solve this problem?"

جاوید nodded eagerly. Wiggle explained that the villagers were throwing away too much trash, and it was polluting the soil, water, and air. جاوید asked, "What can we do to help?"

Wiggle replied, "We need to reduce, reuse, and recycle. We can start by collecting plastic bottles and cans and taking them to the recycling center."

جاوید and Wiggle set off on their mission. They collected plastic bottles and cans from the streets and houses. They met some villagers who were eager to help. Together, they filled a big bag with recyclables.

Now, it's your turn, جاوید! Imagine you are in the village, and you see the following items:

* A plastic water bottle
* A banana peel
* A broken toy
* A newspaper

What would you do with each item?

* For the plastic water bottle: _____ (throw away, reuse, or recycle)
* For the banana peel: _____ (throw away, compost, or feed an animal)
* For the broken toy: _____ (throw away, fix, or donate)
* For the newspaper: _____ (throw away, reuse, or recycle)
