**Introduction**
===============

**Welcome to Jadi's Recycling Adventure!**

Imagine you're Jadi, an 11-year-old living in a bustling city filled with towering skyscrapers and busy streets. One day, while walking home from school, you notice the streets are filled with trash and litter. You start wondering, "What can I do to help keep our city clean?"

**Story**
======

You arrive home from school and decide to talk to your best friend, a clever and eco-conscious robot named **Eco-Bot**. Eco-Bot is always ready to help you learn about taking care of the environment.

"Jadi, I'm glad you're concerned about the trash in our city," Eco-Bot says. "We can make a difference by reducing, reusing, and recycling waste. But first, we need to understand the 3Rs."

Eco-Bot explains that:

* **Reduce** means using fewer plastic bags, straws, and water bottles.
* **Reuse** means finding new uses for items like old jars, bottles, and bags.
* **Recycle** means turning old items into new ones, like turning plastic bottles into playground equipment.

Eco-Bot hands you a recycling bin and says, "Let's go on a mission to reduce waste in our city. We'll visit different locations and make choices about how to handle the waste we find."

You and Eco-Bot arrive at a park and see a lot of trash scattered around. You notice:

* A plastic bottle on the ground
* A old newspaper blowing in the wind
* A broken toy that can't be fixed

What do you do?

A) Pick up the plastic bottle and put it in the recycling bin
B) Use the old newspaper to create a new craft project
C) Throw the broken toy away
D) Leave everything as it is
