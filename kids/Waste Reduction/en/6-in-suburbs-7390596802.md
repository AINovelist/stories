**Introduction**
====================================

Hello علی! Do you know what happens to the trash we throw away every day? Let's go on an adventure to find out!

**Story**
=======

Once upon a time, in a suburb just like yours, there was a magical park filled with tall trees, colorful flowers, and friendly animals. One day, a little rabbit named Remy noticed that the park was filled with trash. Plastic bottles, food wrappers, and broken toys were everywhere!

Remy asked the park's wise old owl, "Why is our park so dirty?" The owl replied, "The humans who live nearby are not reducing, reusing, and recycling their waste properly."

Remy wanted to help, so she asked you, علی, for your assistance. Together, you and Remy decided to take action. You started by sorting the trash into different bins.

*   Plastic bottles went into the recycling bin.
*   Food wrappers were thrown away in the trash bin.
*   Broken toys were put into a special bin for broken items.

As you sorted, you realized that many of the items could be reused. You and Remy came up with a plan to reduce waste in the park.

*   You used old plastic bottles to create bird feeders.
*   You turned food wrappers into colorful wind chimes.
*   You fixed broken toys and gave them to the park's animals as new playthings.

The park began to transform before your eyes! The animals were happy, and the air was clean. Remy thanked you, علی, for your help.
