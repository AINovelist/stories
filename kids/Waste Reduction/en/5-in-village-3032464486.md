**Introduction**
===============

Hello فربد! Do you know what happens to the trash we throw away in our village? Let's go on an adventure to find out! 

**Story**
======

فربد loved playing in the village fields, watching the animals and exploring the woods. But one day, he noticed that the fields were filled with plastic bottles, bags, and cans. He asked his grandma, "grandma, why is our beautiful village so dirty?"

His grandma smiled and said, "Well, فربد, we need to learn how to reduce, reuse, and recycle our waste. Let's go on a mission to make our village clean again!"

فربد and his grandma walked to the village center, where they met their friend, "Recycling Rabbit." The rabbit explained that he needed help sorting the trash into different bins.

Here are the bins:
* **Paper Bin**: for paper, cartons, and cardboard
* **Plastic Bin**: for plastic bottles, bags, and containers
* **Glass Bin**: for glass bottles and jars
* **Compost Bin**: for food waste and garden trimmings

Now it's your turn, فربد! Help sort the trash by choosing where each item goes:

* A plastic bottle: _______________________
* A newspaper: _______________________
* A glass jar: _______________________
* A banana peel: _______________________

فربد thought carefully and helped sort the trash. He put the plastic bottle in the **Plastic Bin**, the newspaper in the **Paper Bin**, the glass jar in the **Glass Bin**, and the banana peel in the **Compost Bin**.

The Recycling Rabbit cheered, "Great job, فربد! You're a waste reduction superstar!" The village began to look cleaner, and the animals were happy again.

**Conclusion**
==========

فربد learned that every small action can make a big difference. He realized that reducing waste is everyone's responsibility. From now on, فربد promised to always sort the trash and encourage his friends to do the same.

Remember, فربد, **every small step counts**, and together we can keep our village clean and beautiful. Keep being an environmental hero and inspire others to join you!
