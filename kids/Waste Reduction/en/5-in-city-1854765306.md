# The Magical Adventures of محسن: Reducing Waste in the City
==============================================

**Introduction**
---------------

**What can محسن do to help keep his city clean?**  
In a bustling city, where buildings touch the sky and cars zoom by, there lives a curious and adventurous boy named محسن. He loves playing with his friends, exploring the city, and going on magical adventures.

**Story**
--------

One sunny day, while محسن was playing in the park, he noticed something peculiar. The park was filled with trash and waste! Plastic bottles, crumpled papers, and broken toys were scattered everywhere. محسن wondered, *"Who made this mess?"*

Suddenly, a friendly squirrel named Squeaky appeared from behind a tree. Squeaky told محسن, *"The city's waste problem is growing, and we need your help to solve it!"* Squeaky explained that when people throw trash on the ground, it hurts the environment and harms animals.

محسن wanted to help. Squeaky gave him a **Magic Recycling Bag** that could collect and sort waste. Together, they set out on a mission to clean the city.

As they walked, they came across a street filled with trash. Squeaky asked محسن, *"What can we do to reduce waste here?"* محسن thought for a moment and then said, *"We can pick up the trash and put it in the recycling bins!"*

They started collecting the trash and sorting it into different bins. محسن learned that:

* Plastic bottles go in the **Blue Bin**
* Paper and cardboard go in the **Green Bin**
* Glass and metal go in the **Yellow Bin**

As they finished cleaning the street, the city looked cleaner, and the air felt fresher. Squeaky was proud of محسن and said, *"You're a real-life superhero, محسن! Every small action you take helps keep our city clean."*

But their adventure wasn't over yet! They stumbled upon a group of people throwing away food waste. Squeaky asked محسن, *"What can we do to reduce food waste?"* محسن thought for a moment and then said, *"We can ask them to use reusable containers and bags!"*

The people listened to محسن's idea and started using reusable containers and bags. The amount of food waste decreased, and the city became even cleaner!
