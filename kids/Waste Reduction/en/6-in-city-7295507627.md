**Introduction**
======================================

Hello جاوید! Do you know what happens to the trash we throw away every day? Let's go on a fun adventure to find out!

**Story**
======================================

جاوید loved playing in his neighborhood park in the city. One day, while he was playing, he noticed that there was a lot of trash on the ground. He saw plastic bottles, broken toys, and food wrappers. "Where does all this trash come from?" جاوید wondered.

As he was thinking, a friendly squirrel named Squeaky appeared. "Hi جاوید! I'm so glad you're wondering about the trash. You see, when we throw things away, they don't just disappear. They either get recycled, or they hurt our planet."

Squeaky took جاوید on a journey to a nearby recycling center. They saw big machines sorting out different types of trash. "Wow!" جاوید exclaimed. "I didn't know we could turn old plastic bottles into new toys!"

But then they saw a big pile of trash that couldn't be recycled. "What about this trash?" جاوید asked. Squeaky said, "This is the trash that people threw away without thinking. It will hurt our planet if we don't reduce it."

Squeaky gave جاوید a special task: **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle**. "Can you help me, جاوید? Can you tell me three things you can do to reduce trash in your daily life?"

* جاوید thought for a moment... 
+ "I can carry my water bottle instead of using a new plastic one every day!"
+ "I can use both sides of my paper before throwing it away!"
+ "I can put my toys in the toy box instead of throwing them on the floor!"

Squeaky was so proud of جاوید! "You're a superstar, جاوید! Every small action you take can make a big difference."

**Conclusion**
======================================

جاوید learned that reducing trash is everyone's responsibility. He understood that every small action he takes can help keep his city clean and beautiful. From now on, جاوید made a promise to himself to reduce, reuse, and recycle.

Can you, جاوید, remember the three things you promised to do to reduce trash?

* Carry your water bottle 
* Use both sides of your paper 
* Put your toys in the toy box 

You can make a difference, جاوید
