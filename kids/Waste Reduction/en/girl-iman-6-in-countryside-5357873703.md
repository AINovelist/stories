**Iman's Amazing Adventure: Reducing Waste in the Countryside**
===========================================================

**Introduction**
---------------

Hi Iman! Do you know what happens to the waste we throw away in the countryside? Let's go on an adventure to find out!

**Story**
--------

Iman loved playing in the beautiful countryside, surrounded by rolling hills and green fields. One day, while exploring, Iman stumbled upon a hidden path they had never seen before. As they walked along the path, they noticed that the ground was covered with all sorts of trash: plastic bottles, torn papers, and food wrappers.

Suddenly, a friendly rabbit named **Rosie** appeared from behind a bush. "Hello, Iman! I've been trying to clean up this mess, but I need your help. Can you help me figure out how to reduce waste in our countryside?"

Iman thought for a moment and then said, "I think we should start by picking up the trash and putting it in the recycling bin!" Rosie nodded in agreement.

As they collected the trash, they came across a sign that read:

**Waste Reduction Tips**

* Reduce: Use less plastic and paper
* Reuse: Use things again and again
* Recycle: Turn old things into new ones

Iman and Rosie decided to follow these tips. They reused old bags to carry their toys and fruits. They also made a compost bin to turn food scraps into fertilizer for the plants.

But then, they encountered a problem: a big, old, broken toy car that couldn't be recycled. What should they do with it?

Do you think Iman and Rosie should:

A) Throw the toy car away
B) Try to fix it
C) Donate it to someone who might need it

What would you do, Iman?

**Enter your answer here**

[Assuming Iman chooses option B or C, the story continues]

Iman and Rosie decided to **try to fix the toy car**. They used glue, scissors, and some creativity to make it work again. Now, the toy car can be played with again, reducing waste and saving resources.

**Conclusion**
----------

Iman and Rosie successfully reduced waste in the countryside. They learned that every small action counts, and by working together, they can make a big difference.

Remember, Iman:

* Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
* Fix things instead of throwing them away
* Every small action helps protect our environment
