**Waste Warriors: Shabnam's Big Discovery**
=============================================

**Introduction**
---------------

Meet Shabnam, a 6-year-old curious and adventurous girl who loves playing in her suburban backyard. One sunny Saturday morning, Shabnam's mom asked her to help with the recycling. As they were sorting out the trash, Shabnam wondered, "Why do we need to separate our trash? What happens to it after we throw it away?"

**Story**
---------

Shabnam's mom smiled and said, "Let's find out!" They put on their thinking caps and decided to investigate. As they walked around their neighborhood, they saw a lot of trash on the streets and in the parks. Shabnam noticed that most of the trash was plastic bottles, bags, and food wrappers.

Suddenly, a friendly squirrel named Squeaky appeared from a nearby tree. "Hello, Shabnam! I've been watching you, and I'm proud of you for wanting to learn about waste reduction. Would you like to join me on a mission to reduce waste in our community?"

Shabnam's eyes widened with excitement. "Yes! I want to be a Waste Warrior!"

Squeaky handed Shabnam a special badge and said, "Now, let's get started! We have three challenges to complete. Are you ready?"

**Challenge 1: Reduce**

Shabnam and Squeaky visited the local farmer's market. They saw many stalls selling fresh fruits and vegetables, but also a lot of single-use plastic bags. Squeaky asked, "How can we reduce the use of plastic bags here?"

Shabnam thought for a moment and then exclaimed, "We can bring our own reusable bags!"

**Challenge 2: Reuse**

Their next stop was the community center, where they saw a lot of paper waste from flyers and brochures. Squeaky asked, "How can we reuse paper instead of throwing it away?"

Shabnam thought creatively and said, "We can use the back of the paper to draw and create art!"

**Challenge 3: Recycle**

Finally, they visited the recycling center. Shabnam saw how the machines sorted and processed the recyclables. Squeaky asked, "What can we do to help the recycling process?"

Shabnam proudly replied, "We can make sure to rinse our bottles and cans before recycling them!"

**Conclusion**
--------------

Shabnam completed the three challenges and became a certified Waste Warrior! Squeaky congrat
