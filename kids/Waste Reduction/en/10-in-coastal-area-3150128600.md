=====================================================

**Introduction**
---------------

Welcome to the story of Matin, a 10-year-old boy who lives in a beautiful coastal area surrounded by the ocean and its incredible creatures. Matin loves playing on the beach and exploring the tide pools, but he's also very concerned about the increasing amount of trash he sees polluting his beloved coast.

One day, while Matin was walking along the beach, he stumbled upon a seagull tangled in a plastic bag. He quickly ran to help the bird, carefully removing the bag and setting it free. The seagull thanked Matin and asked for his help in cleaning up the beach.

"We need your help, Matin!" said the seagull. "Our home is filled with trash, and it's hurting us and our friends. Can you help us reduce waste and keep our coast clean?"

Matin agreed to help and began his journey to make a difference. He started by looking around his own home and neighborhood for ways to reduce waste. He noticed that his family used a lot of plastic water bottles, so he suggested switching to reusable bottles instead.
