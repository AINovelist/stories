**Introduction**
Welcome to "Javid's Big City Wildlife Adventure"! Javid loves living in the big city, but he's always curious about the animals that live there too. One day, Javid wonders, **"What can I do to help protect the animals in my city?"**

**Story**
Javid was playing in his backyard when he heard a faint meowing sound. He looked around and found a tiny kitten hiding behind a bush. The kitten was scared and alone. Javid knew he had to help. He gently picked up the kitten and decided to take care of it.

As he was feeding and playing with the kitten, a friendly **Park Ranger, Ms. Emma**, came to visit. She told Javid that many animals in the city need help and care. Ms. Emma asked Javid to join her on a mission to help protect the city's wildlife.

They went to a nearby park and saw many animals, such as birds, squirrels, and even a few rabbits. Javid was amazed by the variety of creatures living in the city. Ms. Emma explained that these animals need food, shelter, and a safe place to live, just like the little kitten.

Javid decided to help by:
• Feeding the birds with a bird feeder
• Planting a tree to provide shelter for the squirrels
• Creating a safe path for the rabbits to cross the road

Ms. Emma praised Javid for his kind actions and said, *_Every small action can make a big difference!_*

**Conclusion**
Javid realized that taking care of animals in the city is everyone's responsibility. He learned that even small actions, like feeding the birds or planting a tree, can help protect the wildlife. From that day on, Javid made a promise to always look out for the animals in his city.
