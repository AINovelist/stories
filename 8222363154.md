**Story**
---------

In the mountains where you live, there is a beautiful forest filled with tall trees, sparkling streams, and many amazing animals. One sunny day, a curious and brave bear named Bert decided to explore the forest. Bert loved making new friends and playing with the other animals.

As Bert wandered through the forest, he met a wise old owl named Olwen. Olwen asked Bert, "Have you ever noticed how some animals in our forest are struggling to find food and shelter?"

Bert thought for a moment and replied, "I've seen some animals looking hungry and sad. What can we do to help them?"

Olwen said, "We need to protect their homes and make sure they have enough food to eat. We can start by picking up trash and keeping our forest clean."

Bert and Olwen decided to work together to help the animals. They began to pick up plastic bottles, cans, and other trash that hurt the animals and their homes.
