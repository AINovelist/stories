**Introduction**
===============

Hello Atefe! Do you know what's special about the big trees near your home by the coast? They help keep our air clean, provide shade, and are homes to many animals. But sometimes, these amazing trees need our help to stay healthy. Let's go on an adventure to learn how we can be kind to our tree friends!

**Story**
=========

Atefe's Magical Tree Adventure
------------------------------

One sunny day, Atefe decided to explore the coastal forest near her home. As she wandered through the trees, she met a friendly squirrel named Squeaky.

*Squeaky*: "Hello Atefe! I'm so glad you're here. Our trees are in trouble. A big storm is coming, and we need to prepare them to stay safe."

*Atefe*: "How can I help?"

*Squeaky*: "We need to collect some special items to protect the trees. Can you help me find some strong ropes, soft leaves, and fresh water?"

Atefe and Squeaky set off on their mission. They found some sturdy ropes to tie around the trees, soft leaves to cover the roots, and fresh water to quench the trees' thirst.

As they worked, Atefe asked Squeaky, "Why are trees so important?"

*Squeaky*: "Trees give us oxygen, shade, and homes. They also help keep our coast protected from strong winds and waves."

Just then, the wind started to pick up, and the storm clouds gathered. Atefe and Squeaky quickly finished their task.

The storm came and went, but the trees stood strong thanks to Atefe's help. The next day, the sun shone bright, and the trees looked happy and healthy.
