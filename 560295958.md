**Introduction**
===============

In a sunny suburb, where houses and trees stood side by side, a curious four-year-old named Mahan loved exploring the outdoors. One day, while playing in the backyard, Mahan noticed a beautiful tree with a big, yellow ribbon wrapped around its trunk. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves, and Mahan wondered: **What's so special about this tree?**

**Story**
======

As Mahan approached the tree, a friendly squirrel named Squeaky scampered down from a branch. "Hello, Mahan! This is a very special tree," said Squeaky in a squeaky voice. "It's one of the oldest trees in our neighborhood, and it needs our help."

Squeaky explained that the city planned to cut down the tree to make way for a new road. Mahan's eyes widened with worry. "But what can we do to save it?"

Squeaky replied, "We need to collect reasons why this tree is important and present them to the city officials. Can you help me, Mahan?"

Together, Mahan and Squeaky set out on an adventure to gather reasons to save the tree. They met various animals who benefited from the tree:

* A bird named Sam who built a nest in the tree's branches
* A family of rabbits who played beneath its shade
* A wise old owl who used the tree as a home

Each friend shared why the tree was essential to their lives. Mahan and Squeaky wrote down each reason on a leaf and attached it to a big, green poster.

As they worked, Mahan learned that:

* Trees provide shade and shelter
* Trees help keep the air clean
* Trees are home to many animals

**Decision Time!**
----------------

When the poster was full of leaves, Mahan and Squeaky visited the city officials to present their case. The officials were impressed with the many reasons to save the tree. But, they still needed to decide:

Do you think the city officials should:
A) Cut down the tree to make way for the new road
B) Save the tree and find an alternative route
C) Plant more trees along the new road

What do you think, Mahan?

**Conclusion**
==========

The city officials were convinced by Mahan and Squeaky's efforts and decided to **save the tree** and find an alternative route. The yellow ribbon was replaced with a green one, symbolizing the tree's new status as a protected landmark
