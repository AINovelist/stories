**Introduction**
================

In a small village nestled in the mountains, 10-year-old **Nazanin** loved to explore the woods surrounding her home. One day, while wandering through the forest, she stumbled upon a magnificent tree with a door carved into its trunk. The door was slightly ajar, inviting Nazanin to enter. As she pushed the door open, a soft, gentle voice whispered, "Welcome, young one. I have been waiting for you."

**Story**
=========

 Inside the tree, Nazanin met a wise old owl named Olwen. Olwen explained that the tree, named Terra, was the guardian of the forest and its inhabitants. However, the tree was facing a great threat. A strong windstorm was approaching, and the tree's roots were weak due to the lack of water.

Olwen asked Nazanin to help Terra by finding a way to strengthen its roots. Nazanin thought for a moment and then asked, "What can I do to help?" Olwen presented her with three options:

*   **Gather water from the nearby stream**: Nazanin could collect water from the stream and pour it around Terra's roots.
*   **Find a natural fertilizer**: Nazanin could search for natural materials like leaves or pine needles to create a fertilizer for Terra.
*   **Build a supportive wall**: Nazanin could gather stones and branches to build a wall around Terra to protect its roots from the wind.

Which option do you think Nazanin should choose?

(select one option)

*   Gather water from the nearby stream
*   Find a natural fertilizer
*   Build a supportive wall

**Nazanin's decision**

(Nazanin chooses to gather water from the nearby stream)

Nazanin quickly ran to the nearby stream and filled a bucket with water. She poured the water around Terra's roots, making sure the soil was moist and fertile. The tree's roots began to strengthen, and its trunk grew stronger.

Olwen praised Nazanin's decision, saying, "Well done, young one! Your kindness and quick thinking have helped save Terra. The tree will now withstand the windstorm and continue to thrive."

**Conclusion**
==========

As the windstorm approached, Nazanin watched as Terra swayed gently in the wind, its roots firmly grounded. She realized that even small actions could make a significant difference in protecting the environment.
