**The Adventures of Javid: The Water Conservation Hero**

**Introduction**
Have you ever wondered how we get water to drink, play, and clean with? Let's go on an adventure with Javid to discover the secret of water conservation!

**Story**

Javid lived in a bustling city surrounded by tall buildings and busy streets. One sunny day, while playing in the park, Javid saw a big, shiny water truck driving by. The truck had a sign that read: "Water Saving Team." Javid's curiosity was sparked, and he wanted to learn more.

As Javid followed the truck, he met a friendly water droplet named Droppy. Droppy explained that the city's water supply was limited and that every drop counted.

*Droppy asked Javid:* "Do you know how much water we use every day?"

Javid thought for a moment and replied, "I use water to drink, wash my hands, and take a bath."

*Droppy said:* "That's right! But did you know that we can save water by turning off the tap while brushing our teeth or using a cup to rinse our hands?"

Javid's eyes widened with excitement. He wanted to help save water! Droppy gave Javid a special water-saving mission:

"Help your family and friends save water by:

• Turning off the tap while brushing teeth
• Using a cup to rinse hands
• Fixing leaks to avoid wasting water

Can you help us, Javid?"

**What do you think Javid should do?**

(Please imagine your answer, and we'll continue the story)

Javid thought for a moment and said, "I can tell my mom and dad to turn off the tap while brushing teeth, and I can use a cup to rinse my hands!"

*Droppy cheered:* "Hurray! You're a water-saving superstar, Javid!"

**Conclusion**

Javid learned that every small action can make a big difference in saving water. By working together, we can protect our planet's precious water resources.

*Remember, Javid:* "Every drop counts, and you can be a water conservation hero too!"

From now on, Javid will make sure to turn off the tap while brushing his teeth and use a cup to rinse his hands. Will you join Javid in his water-saving mission?
